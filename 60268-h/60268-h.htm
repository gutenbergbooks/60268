<h2>A TRIBUTE TO THE SOLDIERS OF FRANCE</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Georges Clemenceau</span></p>

<p>I watch our blue-uniformed men at war, as
they pass with a friendly and serious look,
generously covered with mud. This is the artillery—slow
marching—which is moving its
cannon under a fantastic camouflage, a mockery
of reality. A glistening slope of soaked earth is
set in a frame of shattered trees, twisted into indescribable
convulsions of anguish with the gaping
wounds inflicted by the storm of iron. On their
horses, already covered with winter shag, the
poilus, slouched in all sorts of positions, having
no suggestion of the rigid form of the manœuvre,
are going from one battlefield to another without
any other thought except that of just keeping on
going.</p>

<p>In colorless and shapeless uniforms, indescribably
rigged out, and in poses of the most pleasurable
leisure, the soldiers of France picturesquely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
slip from glory to glory, less aware, it seems, of
historic grandeur than of serene gladness in implacable
duty. They are picturesque because
nature will have it so, but without any romanticism
or sense of posing—officers hardly to be
distinguished from privates by vague, soiled
stripes—all the men enveloped in a halo of
splendor above anything known to ordinary
humanity.</p>

<p>The pugnacious pipe or the sportive cigarette
hinders their expression of any personal reflection.
Only their eyes are animate, and these express
things which cannot be told in words lest they be
profaned. The line of their lip is youthful under
a silky moustache or firm with age under gray
brush. But the fire of their look, framed in their
dark helmets, leaps out with quiet intensity to
meet the tragic unknown that no longer can bring
surprise. They are our soldiers of the year II
who are following the Biblical column of fire.
They see something. They go to it. Ashamed
of my humility, I should like to find words to say
to them. But, were I a poet, they would have no
need of hearkening to me, since the greatest
beauty of man lies in them, and since, unwitting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
of utterance, which at best seems inept, these men
live on the summits of life.</p>

<p>And the “old classes” who prosaically break
stone at the side of the road or work with the
shovel, the pickaxe, the broom, making the toilette
of the road of triumph, what an injustice if I did
not mention them! How does it happen that the
noblest soldier is always the one I chance upon?
That is the miracle of these men; and when I tell
you that on the battlefield of the Aisne the “old
classes,” not granting that it was necessary to
wait to the end of the battle before beginning to
clear and rebuild, went off into the hottest of the
action to fill up craters, to break stones, to place
tree-trunks and beams during heavy fire, without
vouchsafing the Boche a single hasty gesture, so
that they might the more quickly open the way
for revictualling and for the bringing up of artillery—when
I tell you this, you will admit that
they do not deserve a lesser greeting than their
“young ones.”</p>

<p>And the infantryman—could I commit the
supreme injustice of forgetting him? That is
impossible when one has gone over the battleground
where he has taken possession of the burrows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
of the Boches, among heaps of munition
material, cases of supplies, an indescribable
débris, abandoned with their dead and wounded
in the haste of a desperate fight. What we cannot
understand is that our little poilu can pass so
quickly from the apathy of the trench to the extreme
fury of the attack, and then from the violence
of the offensive to the calm smile of a victory
of which his modesty seems to say: “It was as
easy as all that.”</p>

<p>I did not hear a single boast, or see a disagreeable
act, or hear a word that sounded false. Like
a good-hearted proprietor returning home, they
took possession of the shelters of the Boche so
hurriedly abandoned. Here can be found the
comforts of war, if these two words can be spoken
together. The men talk in groups at the openings
of the underground passages, camouflaged by the
enemy himself. The indifference of their attitudes,
the ease of their familiar conversation, in
which there mingle no bragging (though this is
the place for it), are more characteristic of the
situation of some simple bourgeois who have happened
to meet on Sunday in the street. A major
begs my pardon for wearing a collared shirt,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
which is not perfectly “regular” at an official
review. Messengers pass, throwing out a word
or making a simple sign. Officers step up for
brief explanations. A half-salute, a nodding of
the head—it is over. Not far away, on the road
cut into the rock, where the stupid Boche, after
our passings, sends his impotent shells, our always
young “old classes” hang on to the slopes in
order to see the projectile fall, and make uncomplimentary
remarks about the gunner. Then
work is resumed till the next warning whistles in
the air.</p>

<p>It is after twelve and we have not yet dined.
A big devil of a Moroccan colonel, with a Don
Quixotic face under an extraordinary headpiece,
invites us to his P. C. (post of command), where
the Boche has left useful bits of installation. A
black hole is two steps away from us. We go
down into the ground, over abrupt descents, and
there we are protected from the “marmites” in
a dark corridor lit by candles stuck into the
mouths of German gas masks. We sit down on
anything handy (I even have the favor of a
chair), before a board which also serves as the
colonel’s bed, while arms whose body remains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
invisible serve us with dishes not to be disdained
by a gourmand. How did they get there? I
cannot undertake to explain that. The walk in
the open air, the tragic nature of the place, the
joy in land reconquered, no doubt all lend particular
spice to the comradeship of these men who
forget that they have done great deeds as soon
as they have done them. Pictures and illustrated
pages tremble in the fluttering candle-lights,
among them a Victorious France, drawn by the
pencil of the colonel. A telephonist measures out
mouthfuls of conversation to a military post that
sends in observations and receives ours. Long
time or short time, for here hours and minutes
are alike, here is a magic that ends too soon. We
must go.</p>

<p>The colonel would have been perfect if he had
not made it a point of honor to avoid all danger
for his civilian visitor. In the morning he had
tried to forbid me a flying visit to the marvellous
castle of Pinion, but he finally understood that
even a soldier has to be born a civilian and that
he should not therefore scorn his own origin.
The trip was accomplished without the shadow of
an incident, but the colonel, who insists more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
than ever on the rights and privileges of the uniform,
will not permit me to return until the Boche
cannon favors us with a little respite. The Boche
can hardly make up his mind to such a favor;
hence, several false departures and changings of
direction. Finally, the colonel lets us go under
the guard of a robust sergeant-major, who even
yesterday magnificently led his stretcher-bearers
to the aid of the wounded under the hottest fire.
Although he is not of the youngest class, he has
refused to be retired from the front. He is
spoken of only with respect, I might say admiration.
“He goes everywhere.” He is fine, genial
company. After many necessary little zigzags,
a walk that is not very strenuous and very soon
over, I left the brave sergeant, whom I shall
always remember.</p>

<p>I cannot finish this inconsequent account without
speaking of the touching ceremony which I
witnessed at Soissons, the terribly bombarded.
Since the victory of Malmaison the city has been
out of range. But when you have seen the building
of the sub-prefect tottering with shell-holes,
a building that neither the sub-prefect nor his wife
has left, the shortest walk will tell you a long tale.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span></p>

<p>The general, who is a good fellow—I take
pleasure in saying that—had proposed to show
me something, and so here I am in a public
square having the imposing silhouette of the
cathedral as a background. From the height of
the great towers, with their wide wounds, history,
attentive, looks down. Everywhere there is a formidable
display of cannon taken from the enemy.
There are piles of them, heaps of them. There
are too many to count, together with a bewildering
mass of trench instruments of all sorts. Can
you believe it? They do not hold the eye. How
is that possible? Because on the sidewalk opposite,
in splendid alignment, is the gorgeous gathering
of soldiers with medals and decorations who
have captured these things. Ah! They hold the
eye! There they are, with all sorts of faces and
from all branches of the service, with the flag
which they have followed into battle and which
now must be present at their honor.</p>

<p>To be quite honest, the group is not so æsthetic
as a picture of Versailles. These men are too
great for much ceremony. With a jerky step
the general advances; his brusque movements
reveal the homage of his emotion before the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
bravest of the brave. Slowly he passes along the
line, while the adjutant reads in a stirring voice
the high deeds in the citations. And the military
medal quivers on each noble breast at the recollection
of the tremendous drama lived through.
And the general utters a comrade’s congratulation,
shakes a friendly hand, expresses a good
wish. Then the flag salutes, while the drums
rumble in these hearts drunk with love of country.
At the greeting of the flag of the glorious Chasseurs,
a rag torn by machine guns, something gets
hold of our throats, which the trumpets hurt with
their sublime peal. If there are more beautiful
spectacles, I do not know them. One minute here
is worth years.</p>

<p>And I have said nothing of the people about,
silent, all in mourning, their souls full of tears,
which finally brim over. Men, hats off, motionless
as statues, proud of becoming great through
their children. Mothers, with seared faces, superbly
stoic under the eye of the greater maternity
of the great country. The children in the ecstasy
of feeling about them something greater than
they can understand, but already certain that they
will understand some day this immortal hour.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
And not a cry, not a word sounds in the air, nothing
but the great silence of the courage of all of
them. Then everyone goes away, firm and erect,
to a glorious destiny. In every heart La France
has passed.</p>

<div class="smaller">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—A few days before M. Clemenceau, premier of France,
was called to power, he returned from a visit to the Aisne front and
published his impressions in his paper, <i>L’Homme Enchainé</i>, now
<i>L’Homme Libre</i>. When he became premier, <i>L’Illustration</i> republished
this “Tribute to the Soldiers of France,” and it has since been
widely reproduced and admired throughout France. The present
English translation by Harry Kurz was printed in the <i>New York
Tribune</i>, to the editors of which grateful acknowledgment is made for

<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p>Sergeant-Major Georges Lafond,
of the Territorial Hussars, the
author of this book, was in South America at
the time of mobilization. He returned to France
as soon as possible and joined his corps, but asked
to be assigned as intelligence officer to the machine-gun
sections of the ... first regiment of
Colonial Infantry.</p>

<p>With this picked corps, which has been decimated
several times, he took part in the engagements
in Champagne, on the Somme, at Lihons,
Dompierre, Herbécourt, and notably in the days
from the first to the fifth of July, where the
regiment earned its second citation and received
the <i>fourragère</i>.</p>

<p>Lafond was discharged after the battles of
Maisonnette, and wrote this book of recollections
in the hospital at Abbeville, and afterwards
at Montpellier, where he had to undergo a severe
operation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span></p>

<p>Sergeant-Major Lafond’s narrative makes no
claim to literary pretension, but it is simply a collection
of actual occurrences. It is a series of
short narratives which give the life of a company
of machine gunners from the day of its formation
to the hour when it was so decimated that it had
to be reorganized with men from other corps.</p>

<p>What pictures the following titles call to mind:
“A Reconnaissance in the Fog,” “The Aeroplane,”
“Our First Engagement,” “‘We Have
Taken a Picket Post,’” “The Attack,” “The
Echelon,” “A Water Patrol”! No man who has
lived at the front and has taken part in an attack
will fail to recognize the accuracy of these narratives
and to experience, as well, emotion, enthusiasm,
and pride in having been among “those
who were there.”</p>

<p>This record of adventure was very successful
when it appeared in the <i>Petit Parisien</i>, and I feel
sure that it will be successful in book form. I
beg Sergeant-Major Georges Lafond to accept
my hearty congratulations on his fine talent and
his bravery.</p>

<h1>COVERED WITH MUD AND GLORY</h1>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I<br />
<span class="smaller">THE SEARCH FOR MY COMPANY</span></h2>

<p>I remember the exact date and I have
reason to, for on that Monday, February
fifteenth, I joined the second company of machine
guns of the ... first Colonials at the front.
It was snowing and the fields of Picardy were one
vast white carpet on which the auto-trucks traced
a multitude of black lines to the accompaniment
of pyrotechnics of mud.</p>

<p>Two days before I had left my depot in a small
garrison town in the center of Provence, which
lay smiling in the sun and already bedecked with
the first flowers of spring. At Lyons I found
rain, at Saint-Just-en-Chaussee, snow, and I got
off the train in a sea of mud.</p>

<p>In the dim light of a February dawn, the
station at Villers appeared to be encumbered with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
the supplies of half-a-dozen regiments. My car
was high on its wheels and at the end of the train
farthest from the unloading platform. At the
other end of the platform near the entrance to
the station, I found a rolling bridge for unloading
animals, but it was useless to ask those busy
people to help me push this weighty contrivance
to the car.</p>

<p>So I looked at Kiki—Kiki is my horse—who
had but recently arrived from Canada and was
scarcely broken after his two months’ training
at the depot.</p>

<p>“Kiki, <i>mon vieux</i>,” I said, “you must make
up your mind to do as I did and jump. Remember
that you are a Canadian, and every self-respecting
Canadian should know how to jump
as soon as he is born.”</p>

<p>I delivered this kind invitation from the ground
and I urged him on by pulling on the reins. Kiki
was not at all frightened. He came to the edge
of the car, snuffed the air, carefully calculated
the distance, bent lightly on his hind legs, and
jumped to the ground without a flutter.</p>

<p>“The ... first Colonials?” the military commissioner
said to me. “I don’t know exactly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
but you’ll find it somewhere along twenty or
thirty miles to the east at Proyart or Harbonnières,
or perhaps at Morcourt. There’s a little
of it all about there.”</p>

<p>So Kiki and I, in the morning mist, went slowly
along roads covered with snow and grease in
search of the second company of machine guns.</p>

<p>Proyart is a small village hidden in a hollow
of this plain of Picardy which from a distance
resembled a well-stretched, vast white carpet.
Here the villages are sheltered in depressions and
one only sees them when he reaches the level of
their steeples. It was at Proyart that altogether
accidentally, thanks to a sign about as large as
my hand and already partly rubbed out, I found
the staff of the ... first Colonials.</p>

<p>An orderly condescended to move a few steps
and point out to me at the end of the street to
the right the billets of the quartermaster of the
second company of machine guns.</p>

<p>There was a court—a sewer, as a matter of
fact—which was completely filled by a pool of
filth which left only a narrow passage of a foot
or two by each wall. In a corner was a tangle
of barrels, farm implements, and broken boxes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
and on that a mass of wet straw, manure, snow,
and mud.</p>

<p>At the farther end of the court was a small
door with glass panels—with a glass panel—for
only one remained. The spaces were conveniently
filled by thick layers of the <i>Petit Parisien</i>,
<i>Matin</i>, <i>Le Journal</i>, <i>Echo de Paris</i>, the great
dailies which arrived intermittently at Proyart.</p>

<p>I went in. Kiki wanted to go in, too, but the
door was low and he was carrying his complete
pack. Inside was a ruined kitchen. The chimney
still remained, and there was a large table
made of a door stretched on two barrels, which
took up the middle of the room. In each corner,
against the walls, were improvised beds, straw
mattresses, and heaps of clothes under which I
surmised there were bodies.</p>

<p>“The door, nom de Dieu!” shouted a voice.</p>

<p>In front of the chimney was a man struggling
desperately with a fire. The watersoaked wood
refused to burn, and the man flooded it with shoe
grease, which, when it melted, threw out jets of
yellow flame and filled the room with a pungent
odor and smoke.</p>

<p>“The door, the door! What did he tell you!”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
cried in different tones voices which came from
the heaps of covers.</p>

<p>It was true that a breath of cold air and a
swirl of snow had rushed into the smoky dark
hall when I came in. I shut the door and
asked,</p>

<p>“Is this the second company of machine
guns?”</p>

<p>“What of it? What do you want of the
second machine guns? It’s here. And after that
what do you want? Papers, again? Zut! They
have no idea of bothering people at this hour.
Leave them on the table and come back in half
an hour.”</p>

<p>This diatribe emanated from a pile thicker
than the rest, in the chimney corner. At this
obsession of papers, of lists to be signed, I guessed
he was a sergeant or a quartermaster, and I
kept on:</p>

<p>“Don’t worry. There are no papers. I am
the mounted intelligence officer attached to this
company.”</p>

<p>“M ...!” shouted several voices in the four
corners of the room, while I watched arms and
muffled heads rise up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>“<i>Mince!</i> So we have a mounted officer now!
Wonderful! They’re certainly fitting us out in
style. What won’t they do next? Then, that’s
all right, <i>vieux</i>. Come on in and let us see you.
And you have a horse? Where is your horse?
Bring him in; make him come. It must be cold
out in the court.”</p>

<p>The first burst of curiosity soon passed, the
torrent of words exhausted itself, and the forms
which had stirred a moment ago quieted down
anew. A more peremptory voice now started in
shouting invectives at the orderly who was still
struggling with the rebellious wood.</p>

<p>“Say, Dedouche. Do you think we’re Boche
sausages that you want to smoke us out? Don’t
you know anything? We’ll have to wear glasses.
That’s no way to light a fire. What did you
learn when you were a boy?”</p>

<p>“The grease is full of water and won’t even
burn.”</p>

<p>“Use the oil in the lamp, then.”</p>

<p>The first result of the immediate execution of
this order was to fill the room with a black stifling
cloud which was enough to make one weep. In
the middle of this smoke the orderly, Dedouche,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
coughed, spat, sputtered, while I heard him
storm:</p>

<p>“In God’s name, how that stinks! How that
stinks!”</p>

<p>The quartermaster, doubtless on account of the
smoke and the smell, now deigned to get up. He
was a young man, large, light complexioned, and
his checks were red and fat. He had just a suspicion
of a moustache. His ears were hidden
in a cap which had wings that pulled down. One
could scarcely see his eyes they were so puffed
out with sleep and smoke.</p>

<p>“So you’re the intelligence officer? Sit down.
Dedouche, make a cup of coffee. I’ll make a
note of your transfer, and then you can try to
find a place for yourself until the lieutenant comes.
Oh, you’ve time, you know. He never comes
before ten o’clock.”</p>

<p>“But, Quartermaster, it’s nearly ten now.”</p>

<p>“No, you’re joking. Ten o’clock. My word,
it’s true. Oh, there, get up all of you. It’s ten
o’clock. And that salaud of a Dedouche hasn’t
lighted the fire. Come, come, hurry up, the lieutenant
is coming!”</p>

<p>And as though this were the magic word, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
lieutenant came in, leaving the door wide open
behind him. It was time; they were almost
suffocated.</p>

<p>The lieutenant was a large man, thin and well
set up. His bearing indicated resolution. His
brown hair was cut very short, according to the
regulations. A close-cropped black moustache
streaked his sunburned face. The general effect
of his personality was that of a man cool and
headstrong.</p>

<p>“Oh, he has the coolness of a Colonial,” the
machine gunners repeated <i>ad nauseam</i>.</p>

<p>“Isn’t there any way to get you up?” exclaimed
the lieutenant. “You ought to be
ashamed of yourselves. It’s after ten o’clock.”</p>

<p>Then he saw me through the cloud of smoke
and questioned me with a glance. The quartermaster
broke in before I could reply,</p>

<p>“It’s the mounted intelligence officer, Lieutenant.”</p>

<p>“Oh, good!... Good morning....
Welcome.”</p>

<p>He extended a large, vigorous hand which confirmed
the first impression of his personality—frankness
and will.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>“Have you found a place for your horse?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“Not yet, Lieutenant. I’ve just come.”</p>

<p>I pointed out Kiki through the door to the
courtyard where he waited, stoically and calmly,
under the snow. Perhaps he remembered the
times not long ago that he waited for hours at
the doors of the ranch under more wintry winds.
Perhaps he imagined that he was still waiting for
the rough Canadian pioneer who tarried for long
discussions about business, warming himself the
while with whiskey. At any rate Kiki waited
stoically and quietly. He scarcely condescended
to welcome us by a glance when I presented him
to the lieutenant, who stroked his head.</p>

<p>“This is Kiki, Lieutenant. I don’t know his
real name, for his record bore only his number,
but that fits him and he seems to like it. He is
a Canadian, seven years old, thin but strong, very
gentle and a good jumper.”</p>

<p>“He’s pretty. Come along. We’ll put him
in with mine. They’ll get along all right together.”</p>

<p>So I took Kiki by the bridle and the lieutenant
and I went along talking, until we reached an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
improvised stable where the officer’s horse and
his groom were quartered.</p>

<p>Zèbre was a great brown horse, with a huge,
calm face. Everything here certainly gives an
impression of calmness.</p>

<p>I took leave of the officer for the time being
and returned to the quartermaster’s, where a
steaming soup and scalding coffee were waiting
for me. It was nearly noon and I had eaten nothing
hot for the last forty-eight hours. It was
four above zero and it was time.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="smaller">THE QUARTERMASTER’S BILLETS</span></h2>

<p>I was seated under a shed of loose boards in
the courtyard of Cantonment No. 77, and
just tasting some excellent macaroni which the
cook had warmed up for me, when Dedouche,
the orderly, came to find me.</p>

<p>“Say, Sergeant,” he asked, “are you the intelligence
officer?”</p>

<p>The title of “sergeant” sounds strange in the
ears of a cavalryman, and I felt a little hurt in
my <i>esprit de corps</i>; but I at once answered Dedouche’s
summons, for the orderly, in spite of
being at the beck and call of everyone, enjoys
a certain prestige. He has a real importance,
small though it be, but an importance which carries
weight when he gives his opinion in the discussions
of the “little staff” of the company.</p>

<p>This staff is the household of the quartermaster’s
billets. With some slight differences it
is in general composed of the quartermaster-sergeant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
lacking a sergeant-major which companies
of machine guns rarely have, a quartermaster-corporal,
an adjutant and a mess corporal.
I was admitted to the honor of taking part in
the discussions of the staff on account of the
detached and unusual character of my duties.</p>

<p>But Dedouche was summoning me. I turned
and observed him leisurely. Dedouche is an excellent
fellow. Without even knowing him one
would guess it at first glance. He is good-natured,
never in a hurry, no matter how urgent
his errand, and indifferent alike to blows and
invectives. He smiles under torrents of abuse
and threats of the most terrible punishments, and
does his duty as man of all work silently. In a
word, he possesses all the qualities inherent in
his duty. He is tall and spare; his face is beardless
and sanctimonious; his eyes smile, but they
look far away under his great round glasses with
their large rims. All in all Dedouche looks like
a lay brother. To complete the illusion, when
he talks he has a habit of thrusting his hands
into the large sleeves of his jacket and lowering
his head to look over his spectacles. In civil life
Dedouche was an assistant in a pharmacy in one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
of the large provincial cities. He knows the art
of making up learned formulae. His long slim
fingers manage the most fragile things with skill,
and his grave voice is accustomed to the mezzotints
of the laboratory.</p>

<p>“Yes,” I answered at last, “it is I.”</p>

<p>“The lieutenant wants you.”</p>

<p>I gulped down my plate of macaroni in two
mouthfuls, swallowed the coffee which the cook,
already attentive to my wants, held out to me,
and followed Dedouche the two hundred yards
which separated us from the billets.</p>

<p>Two hundred yards is nothing, and yet it is
a world. In less time than it takes to tell it I
learned a mass of things from Dedouche.</p>

<p>First, what part of the country we are from.
The ... first Colonials was organized in the
South. So, in the hope of finding in each newcomer
another “countryman,” Dedouche asked
the new arrival at once,</p>

<p>“What part of the country are you from?”</p>

<p>He had some doubt about my reply. A Hussar
of a regiment with an unknown number, who had
given little opportunity to study his accent, might
be a man from the North or the East. “One<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
never knows with these cavalrymen,” he seemed
to say, “they’re so uncertain.” So he changed
the form and varied his traditional question
somewhat,</p>

<p>“You’re not from the South, by chance,
Sergeant?”</p>

<p>At this repetition of his offense about my title,
I thought that I ought to slip in a discreet observation,
so I said,</p>

<p>“In the cavalry, my friend, the sergeant is
called ‘<i>maréchal des logis</i>.’” And then having
satisfied my slightly offended <i>esprit de corps</i>, I
replied, “Yes, mon <i>vieux</i>, I am from the South,
in fact from the Mediterranean, from L’Herault.”</p>

<p>“How things happen!” exclaimed Dedouche.
“I’m from Le Clapas.”</p>

<p>Le Clapas is the nickname given to Montpellier
in the territory. And at that there came all at
once a bewildering flow of words. Dedouche
began to tell me, mixing it all up in an incredible
confusion, about his birthplace, his adventures,
his former regular occupation, in the depths of
a pharmacy in a small street under the shadow
of the University, his transfer from the auxiliary
to active service, his wound in Champagne. All<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
this was interspersed with frequent exclamations
and repetitions, “Say, tell me, <i>Maréchal</i>, will
this war ever be over?” and then regrets for his
home land, “Say, tell me, <i>Logis</i>, wouldn’t it be
better down there in the good sun?”</p>

<p>In these different attempts to get nearer to the
term “<i>maréchal de logis</i>,” I observed Dedouche’s
obvious good will, but what interested me most
was a little advance knowledge about the
company.</p>

<p>So Dedouche sketched in a few words a picture
of it, which was absolutely accurate, as I was
able to appreciate later.</p>

<p>“The lieutenant is a very chic type. No one
would think to look at him that he is from the
South, too. He appears cold and hard, like that,
but it’s not natural; he puts it on. He’s good-hearted
at bottom. He’s a Basque and isn’t
afraid of anything. You ought to have seen him
in Champagne at Massiges. Oh, and then we
have besides his fellow countryman, Sub-Lieutenant
Delpos, a blond. He’s not here now;
he’s down at Morcourt with the echelon. He’s
a type too, not stuck-up, but he’s agreeable and
good-humored.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, those in the billets,” Dedouche sketched
with a vague wave of the hand, as if to say something
like this: “They’re of no importance;
they’re brothers, friends, and not worth talking
about.” Perhaps his gesture meant something
else, but that’s what I thought it meant.</p>

<p>And as if he were responding to my implied
question, he went on:</p>

<p>“—there is only the drummer who’s from
the South, too; he’s what they call the ‘quartermaster
corporal,’ I don’t know why. He’s a
good fellow, but he does not talk. At least he
only talks rarely, and he’s from Marseilles, too;
no one would think it to see him. He makes
me mad most of the time.</p>

<p>“Oh, the rest! The corporal of infantry is
from Paris. I don’t know him. He only came
five or six days ago. He hasn’t told us anything
yet; he only sings. And what songs! Good God,
they’re enough to make one blush!</p>

<p>“The <i>juteux</i>—the adjutant,” interrupted Dedouche,
for he rarely used slang. With the exception
of “<i>pinard</i>” and “<i>tacot</i>,” which have
become hallowed and have taken an official place
even in the most refined language of the armies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
Dedouche rarely used a vulgar or misplaced word
in his conversation. This was not because he was
opposed to it nor from false modesty, but because
his occupation as a “scientist” had given
him the habit of using good language.</p>

<p>“The adjutant,” went on Dedouche, “he’s
not an adjutant. He’s a brother, a father, a
friend, a man, what! Never a word of anger,
never a punishment, always agreeable and kind.
And in spite of that he’s had a career. He’s
been in Morocco, China, and Madagascar, and
no one knows where else. He’s been in the
service eleven years, but you wouldn’t think it
to look at him.”</p>

<p>This running biography brought us to the open
door which framed the lieutenant’s tall figure.</p>

<p>“Say, <i>Margis</i>” (the lieutenant knew his military
terminology and this abbreviation was not
without zest), “are you rested from your
journey?”</p>

<p>“I wasn’t tired, Lieutenant.”</p>

<p>“How about your horse?”</p>

<p>“No more than I was. Do you think that
after three days stretched out on the straw in
his car, without moving ...?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then, if you are willing, we’ll both go to the
echelon.”</p>

<p>“All right, Lieutenant.”</p>

<p>A question must have framed itself on my face,
for he added almost at once:</p>

<p>“Yes, the echelon, the fighting train, the cavalry.
You’ll be more at home there. We left
it below at Morcourt, seven or eight miles away,
on account of the shells that fall here sometimes.
Horses, you know, cost more than men, so we
have to economize them. It is understood, then?
We’ll go about noon. Saddle both horses. Meet
me here.”</p>

<p>Then he strode off and joined a group of officers
who were coming up the main street of the
village to the church.</p>

<p>Dedouche was already full of attention for
me—just think of a man from home on the
“little staff”—and he now burst forth eagerly:</p>

<p>“Don’t trouble yourself, <i>Logis</i>. I’ll tell the
groom to saddle the horses and bring them here.”</p>

<p>The smoke still persisted in the dark, littered
confusion of the room, but combined with it now
was an odor of burnt grease mixed with the
moldy smell of a ragout with onions and strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
cheese. In addition, spread out on the table, were
the remnants of a meal, which had just been
finished, the rolls, the account books and reports.</p>

<p>The quartermaster-corporal, the silent fellow
from Marseilles, immersed in reading <i>Le Soleil
du Midi</i>, did not even condescend to look up. In
response to my friendly good-by, he let a scarcely
perceptible “adieu” slip through his lips.</p>

<p>The quartermaster was stretched out on a dirty
mattress thrown on the ground, and juggling two
packages of English cigarettes, while he sang at
the top of his lungs—and what a voice he had!—the
latest song:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="verse indent2"><i>Les journaux vous l’ont dit.</i></div>
<div class="verse indent2"><i>C’est aussi mon avis.</i></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This intellectual refrain must have given him
extreme pleasure, for he began it again and again
without any interruption.</p>

<p>“Well,” I said, “judging from the looks of
things, you aren’t often disturbed here?”</p>

<p>At this the drummer cast me a searching look,
cold, disdainful and commiserating, as much as
to say to me,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>“One can see that you’ve just come!”</p>

<p>As for the quartermaster, he replied to everything
in the repertoire of the <i>Eldorado</i>. Without
stopping his juggling, he shouted at me in his
amazing voice:</p>

<p>He was going on when the infernal noise of
some aerial trolley tore through space.</p>

<p>“Attention!” he cried, without moving from
his mattress. “There’s the Metro!”</p>

<p>Almost at the same moment, a great shell, a
“310” at least, burst in the court of the house
opposite, demolished the roof, and crushed a
dozen horses.</p>

<p>The adjutant was just crossing the street and
he stopped at the door to estimate the damage.</p>

<p>“They missed the steeple again,” he said, with
a disdainful shrug for the Boche artillery.</p>

<p>And Morin, the drummer, by way of commentary,
without interrupting his reading:</p>

<p>“Close the door. If they send any more shells,
that will make a draft.”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="smaller">THE ECHELON</span></h2>

<p>From Proyart to Morcourt is five miles by a
crossroad which in its many curves and windings
cuts across trenches, communication trenches
and barbed wire.</p>

<p>The snow had stopped, but it still covered the
ground, the trees and the farms with its regular
white covering. The communication trenches
showed black on this vast screen.</p>

<p>The crows circled in innumerable flights and
sought in vain for the carrion which had been so
abundant for months and which, to-day, was
buried.</p>

<p>We went along, boot to boot, slowly, for the
roads were slippery. Kiki wanted to dance about,
for the keen air made him lively. But Zèbre’s
sedateness dismayed him, and Kiki wisely ranged
alongside and regulated the pace by his.</p>

<p>The lieutenant talked but little—a few detached
words, chopped phrases, about the company,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
an observation on the weather, a reflection
on the horses.</p>

<p>The road was almost deserted save for a few
Territorials, muffled in their sheepskins, who
dragged along their heavy wooden shoes which
were made even higher by a thick sole of snow.
From time to time a company wagon, driven like
an express train, grazed us with its wheels and
splashed us with mud.</p>

<p>Then, abruptly, without having had to climb the
slightest hill, we saw Morcourt, as one sees suddenly
from the top of a cliff the sea at his feet, in
the midst of the thousand windings of the Somme,
of the canal and the turf-pits. Morcourt is a village
scarcely as large as Proyart, and like it hidden
in a gully sheltered from the winds on all
sides, and also like it, hidden under the snow.</p>

<p>A blacksmith had set up his forge in the open
air against the walls of a tottering tile-kiln. All
around the snow had melted in great black puddles
where the waiting horses had pawed the ground.
The smoke from his fire rose red-tinted and dark
in the heavy air which seemed to muffle the ring
of the hammers on the anvil.</p>

<p>We come to a stop before a house nearly in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
ruins, whose tottering remains are a constant menace.
A corporal rushes out—nimble, short and
thick-set, a small Basque cap binding his sunburned
forehead—and then some men come from the
neighboring stables.</p>

<p>The houses in the country which were invaded
for a short time and in which troops have had
their cantonments for long weary months all look
alike. Their doors and windows are gone, but
these are replaced by tent canvas.</p>

<p>The drivers of the echelon and the war train
in the machine-gun companies are nearly always
sailors, the older classes of the Territorials, who
after many changes have been assigned to the
Colonial regiments. No one knows why, but it is
probably because the bureaucratic, stay-at-home
mental worker finds some relationship between the
Colonials and the sea. And so they make these
men, accustomed to the management of ships,
infantrymen, or drivers, or even cavalrymen. But
with the unfailing readiness and the ingenuity
of their kind they make up so much for all that,
that far from appearing unready and badly
placed, one would say that they were veterans already
broken to all the tricks of the trade.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>Their long ship voyages and the necessities of
critical hours have taught them to replace with
the means at hand most things in material existence.
From an old preserve box and a branch of
a tree, squared and split with a hatchet, they make
a strong and convenient table. With a scantling
and a bit of wire lattice taken from a fence, they
make an elastic mattress which, covered with
straw and canvas, becomes a very comfortable
bed.</p>

<p>The sailor is carpenter: the hatchet in his hand
takes the place of the most ingenious tools of the
joiner; painter: he has painted and refitted his boat
from its tarry keel to the scroll work of the bulwarks
and the figures and the beloved words they
put on the stern; mender: he mends his sails and
nets artistically; cook: during the long days at sea
on his frail craft with its limited accommodations,
he makes the most savory dishes from the fruits
of his fishing and a few simple spices. His qualities
and his knowledge are numerous and wide:
astronomer and healer, and, as well, singer of
beautiful songs which cradle his thought at the
will of the rhythms, as the sea rocks his boat at
the will of the waves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>But in this multiplicity of talents he lacks that
of a driver, and what is more, a driver of a
machine gun. That is a job which combines the
heavy and the mountain artillery. A machine-gun
driver should be able to drive in the saddle
the leading team of horses and put the heavy
caisson of ammunition through the most difficult
evolutions. Again, he should be able to drive on
foot the mule loaded with his pack-saddle and
through the most impossible and sometimes the
most dangerous paths.</p>

<p>We had scarcely begun to swallow a cup of
thick, smoking, regulation coffee in a room of the
cantonment, furnished with special skill, when Sub-Lieutenant
Delpos—smart, carefree, smiling, a
cap on the back of his head and a song on his
lips—arrived.</p>

<p>Dedouche’s description seemed to me to be exact.
He was indeed a very young man, very quick,
very blond and very gay. He was already an
officer when others of his age had scarcely left
college; he was already a hero counting in his
active service a thousand feats of prowess when
his rather sceptical contemporaries were content
to read about them in books. Open merriment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
shone in his eyes. He had gained his promotion
in the field far from the stifling atmosphere of
study halls. Yesterday he was still a sergeant in
Madagascar, Senegal, and Morocco; to-day he
is an officer who has fought since the beginning
of the Great War; to-morrow he will be a trainer
of men. He knows them all; many are his old
bedfellows or companions of the column. His
remarks are keen and unrhetorical and they please
the men. They love him and fear him; they are
free with him and respect him. They know that
he understands his trade perfectly and that they
can deceive him in nothing.</p>

<p>Our introduction was short and unceremonious.
A man brought on the table a bottle of very sweet
Moselle wine, which is christened at the front
“Champagne.” It was one of those wines which
make up for their qualities by such pompous appellations
and well-intentioned labels as “Champagne
de la Victory,” “Champagne de la Revenge,”
“of the Allies,” “of the Poilu,” “of
Glory.” They are all equally bad, but they make
a loud noise when the cork is drawn and most of
the wine flows away in sparkling foam.</p>

<p>We drained our cups to the common health,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
and to the success and certain glory of the
company.</p>

<p>Then the lieutenant, who has memories of the
drama, said in a voice which recalled the tones
of the already classic Carbon de Casteljaloux, his
neighbor,</p>

<p>“Since my company has, I believe, reached its
full number, shall we not show it to the <i>logis</i>, if
you please?”</p>

<p>Under the rays of an anemic sun which had
waited until the hour of sunset before it deigned
to appear, we made a brief visit to the echelon.</p>

<p>First the roll; five corporal muleteers or
drivers: Raynal, the owner of a vineyard in
Gironde; Liniers, a salesman of wines and spirits
and a great elector in the Twelfth Arrondissement;
Glanais, Bonecase, Glorieu, carpenter,
vine-grower, and farmer—and none of them had
ever managed a horse in his life.</p>

<p>And the men—one in fifty is a cavalryman—but
that one is perfect. He was trained at the
cavalry school at Saumur; trained horses and bred
them, so they at once turned him over to the echelon,
where he had to lead a mule by the bridle.
That, of course, was a reproach to his old trade,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
so in default of any other satisfaction it taught
him the philosophy of resignation and peaceful
blessedness.</p>

<p>The cavalry!</p>

<p>“Oh, the cavalry, that’s been posing five minutes,”
said Sub-Lieutenant Delpos—he was extremely
fond of that expression.</p>

<p>There were horses and mules varying in age
from five to seventeen. They were all sensible,
settled down, their legs somewhat worn out, and
more accustomed to the hearse than to a caisson,
and more familiar with the song of the worker
than with the roar of cannon. They were all
gentle, only demanding oats and straw; some with
their bones sticking out of their hides, while others
were still sleek and shiny from their warm stables
and fresh straw; all unconscious of what awaited
them on the morrow.</p>

<p>One of the mules was a veteran, an enormous,
cunning animal. His hair was short and rough,
and in places there were great patches where the
hide showed. His skin was hung on a projecting
framework of bones, and, although he was
well fed, he was very thin—with a thinness so
unyielding to rations that it was impossible to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
get him fat. His head was that of an epicurean
philosopher with deep mocking eyes. This was
Chocolate.</p>

<p>Chocolate is beyond the time when he has an
age. The oldest soldiers in the regiment have
always known him, even at Marrakech and Rabbat
in Morocco.</p>

<p>Chocolate has made many campaigns during
his active service and he has received several
wounds as well.</p>

<p>The story goes that one day in Morocco Chocolate
got loose from the bivouac, and started
browsing on the grass and wild oats in an ambuscade—between
two fires. Absolutely indifferent
to the crackling of bullets which he had
known from infancy, he continued to lop off the
plants until the pernicious bullets began to graze
his skin. Then he stretched out at full length in
a hollow in the sand and browsed on the grass
within reach of his teeth, while he waited the
end of the adventure. Then he went back to
the bivouac in search of a pail of water and a bag
of oats.</p>

<p>Now Chocolate is the file leader. He indicates
by his example to the horses whom the pack-saddle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
galls that the best way of carrying it is to avoid
romping to the right and the left, shifting about,
and trotting, in fact, all movements which misplace
the saddle or wrinkle the skin beneath. The
secret is to work soberly, slowly and at an even
pace.</p>

<p>Chocolate belongs to a family of mules which
ranks high in history. The broad, rounded backs
of his ancestors have borne debonnair sovereigns,
preacher monks, magnificent Sultans and Sancho
Panzas, baskets of vegetables and cans of milk.
To-day Chocolate, their descendant, carries an
infernal instrument—a machine gun. But what
matters that to him? The road rolls on before
him and he follows it. There are oats at the
end, to-night or to-morrow, what difference does
it make?</p>

<p>“He is cool,” the drivers say. Coolness is the
great secret of the Colonials.</p>

<p>Coolness, indifference to danger, bad weather,
adversity, obstacles, death—no nervousness, no
useless bursts of anger, no dangerous hurrying,
no false starts. It is necessary to go—they will
go—they arrive. That is all.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV<br />
<span class="smaller">THE SONG OF THE MACHINE GUN</span></h2>

<p>Dedouche brings me a note to sign for
on the report book. It reads:</p>

<p>“The non-commissioned officers will assemble
their sections in the courtyard of Cantonment
No. 77 at 2.30. Each gun captain will present
his gun. Service marching order, with masks and
arms.”</p>

<p>I sign mechanically to please Dedouche, who
thinks he is showing me a special favor by offering
me the first reading of all orders and reports.
But this one interests me but little, for I have
neither arms nor guns to present. So it is as a
spectator that I am present at the lieutenant’s
inspection. This time I shall see the complete
company.</p>

<p>I find myself at the appointed hour at Cantonment
77.</p>

<p>One must have lived in these remains of villages,
which persist in standing, near the lines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
to have an exact idea of what they are. In these
villages furious combats have taken place in the
streets, from house to house, and for two years
they have been occupied and overpopulated—a
hamlet of one hundred and fifty inhabitants often
serves as a cantonment for ten thousand men—by
men of all arms of the service, from all regions,
of all colors.</p>

<p>It is not ruin in all its tragic horror and majesty.
It is worse.</p>

<p>It is something which appears to want to live,
but which a latent leprosy eats away. Often
there are traces of shells, the splatter of bullets,
the marks of fire; the roofs may have fallen in
from the recent shelling, but even yet the general
effect is that the houses on the streets are still
standing.</p>

<p>The fronts of these houses, made of straw
and mud, with only a large door swinging on its
hinges, are whole. Of course the mud has often
been scratched in long, leprous wounds, and the
straw tumbles out leaving the bare skeleton of
worm-eaten wood; and, besides, the windows are
without the glass, which has been broken to bits by
the explosion of shells, and which is replaced by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
bits of paper or by calendars. But the real ruin
is inside.</p>

<p>Here is the work of the carelessness and negligence
of the wandering multitudes who pass that
way, who arrive at evening, tired, muddy, wet,
who fall asleep on damp straw, cut to pieces and
crawling with vermin, and who go on the next
day, or three days later, leaving as a mark of
their passing a greater stench and a greater
dilapidation.</p>

<p>The ruin is inside. It is not the beautiful ending
of destruction by fire, but the slow death by
cancer which eats away, by gangrene which mounts
from the cattle sheds to the stable, from the stable
to the barn, and from the barn to the hearth. And
at last a day comes when the front alone is standing
on the ruin of the annihilated house, and then
men who are passing by, seeing that it is tottering
and dangerous, cut it down with blows of the
axe and chop the wood into bits for their little
needs.</p>

<p>And so these houses die: houses which under
their humble appearance had great souls palpitating
with life, where lives were born and passed
their years; where joys and griefs exclaimed and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
wept, where the peasant, the son of the soil, drew
from this soil, the generatrix of strong races, the
re-vivifying harvests which he stored away in
the barn which to-day is dead.</p>

<p>Whole villages and great villages agonize in
this way through months of wearing away, and
their end is no less terrible, no less majestic, no
less pitiful than of those villages with glorious
names which the wrath of shells beats into dust.</p>

<p>Cantonment 77 is made up of those houses
which waste away. Between the fragile walls,
notched by an empty barn and a fallen shed, opens
a courtyard. Filth spreads out in a vast pool on
which float among the refuse a pile of garbage,
boxes, the waste of cooking and greasy papers.</p>

<p>In the corner of a recess open to every wind,
on piles of bricks held together by iron bars pulled
from the window sills, the cook has set his pots
and bowls in line. His fire of wood so green that
the sap oozes out licks the already blackened walls
with its long flames.</p>

<p>All that offers even a precarious shelter—a
roof—is occupied by the men who crowd in there
on old, filthy straw, and on the meager rations
of fresh straw, often too fresh. And as the tiles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
and thatch let the rain filter through, they stretch
above them strips of tent canvas.</p>

<p>Oh, blessed canvas! To what uses is it not put!
It serves as a roof against bad weather, the rain
and snow; a protection against dampness, mud
and vermin; planted on two stakes, stretched to
a door casing, it protects the fires for cooking
from draughts; in the more comfortable cantonments
in the rear, where the straw is clean and
abundant, where the men are at last able to take
off their shoes, and their muddy leggings and their
trousers heavy with dampness, it serves as the bed
clothes; and, finally, at the last hour it is in the
tent canvas that they collect the bodies with their
torn and shattered limbs. It serves as shroud and
coffin. And, faithful to its rôle, it is the last
shelter.</p>

<p>The men began to arrive by groups almost in
order, at any rate as much so as the littered
ground in the courtyard would permit. They assembled
by sections in a half circle around the
pool of filth. It was certainly a picturesque sight
when, at the command “Attention,” these men
mounted a faultless guard around this fetid pool,
where, among papers, tossed about and dirty, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
box covers, there floated, bloated and fetid, all
kinds of carrion, the rats of the last hecatomb.</p>

<p>Near the doorway on the largest and cleanest
part of the courtyard the eight machine guns were
drawn up in line.</p>

<p>Eight machine guns, the armament of the
company.</p>

<p>Eight guns, so small, so fine, and such bits of
workmanship, that one would think to see them
that they were a child’s playthings.</p>

<p>The machine guns appeared very coquettish and
pretty as they rested on their bluish-gray tripod,
with their steel barrels well burnished even to the
mouth of their muzzles. They hardly appeared
at all threatening with the polished leather of
the breech, where the bronzed fist of the gun
layer stood out in graceful designs, and the
attenuated round and svelte circles of the
radiator.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;" id="illus2">
<img src="images/illus2.jpg" width="700" height="430" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Remains of Villages near the Lines</span> <a href="#Page_36"><i>See page 36</i></a></p>
</div>

<p>And the machine gun is a coquette, too. Under
its appearance of delicacy and grace it conceals a
terrible power of domination and strength. Yet
it hurls pitiless death without noise, with a rapidity
as furtive as a shout of laughter, with a tac-tac
which is scarcely perceptible and which is no more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
menacing than the familiar tac-tac of the sewing-machine
or the typewriter.</p>

<p>And the machine gun is a coquette, too! Fashioned
like a work of art, the brilliancy of its
polished steel and the voluptuous roundness of the
brass invite caresses. Its shots come from they
know not where, since they can see nothing—a
bush is sufficient to conceal it; light, it is here one
minute and there another; it is not visible until
one is almost upon it, yet its shots are fatal at
some miles.</p>

<p>It is delicate and costly, needing a hundred
things for its adornment, skilled care for its
toilet and a hundred men to serve. Is not the
machine gun a coquette?</p>

<p>As the Company Casanova is of recent formation
it received an entirely new armament of the
latest model. The guns are built on the Hotchkiss
system—the last word of perfection in war.
They are light, scarcely fifty pounds, and they are
easy to manipulate skilfully. The rapidity of their
fire is extreme, more than five hundred shots a
minute, and their adjustment is such that they
can fire on the most varied objects. First, there
is blockade fire, which concentrates all the shots<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
on a narrow point; then the sweeping fire, which
sweeps the whole of an extended field; and finally,
indirect fire, which hits its designated target with
mathematical precision, at the same time concealing
the source.</p>

<p>The machine gun is the little queen of battles.
One may smile to look at her, but one shudders
when he thinks of her ravages.</p>

<p>And the men are proud of their guns.</p>

<p>I observe them while the lieutenant speaks to
them and their eyes look alternately at the lieutenant
and at their respective guns. They know their
gun; they love her; possess her. They have confidence
in her, and it is she who defends them.</p>

<p>To-day there are about one hundred and fifty
men grouped in the same specialty, from all
regions, all regiments, all arms, who have come
after more or less lengthy stays in the instruction
camps at Nice, Clermont, and La Valbonne.</p>

<p>Their specialty has created among them a certain
sort of affinity, a family characteristic. Machine
gunners are an element apart, a sort of
élite. In their ranks there is a certain homogeneity
which comes from the practice of the same
competency which is nearly a science. They feel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
somewhat superior to, at least different from, the
ordinary companies.</p>

<p>They appreciate the worth of their distinction
and scarcely ever associate with other troops.
The companies of infantry are swamped in a battalion,
while the companies of machine guns are
isolated, autonomous, directly dependent on the
commanding officer, and they enjoy an absolute
initiative in a battle. Finally, they are not anonymous
or numbered; they are not called the fifth,
seventh, or the twelfth, but the “Company Casanova,”
as they once said Royal-Piémont or Prince
Condé.</p>

<p>Then, too, there is their insignia. The insignia
is the bauble, the jewel, of the soldier. It is a real
satisfaction to have something on the uniform
which distinguishes one from his neighbor. To
such a point do they carry this that many cannot
resist putting on insignia to which they haven’t
the slightest right. And none of the insignia
arouses greater envy than the two small intersecting
cannons of the machine guns.</p>

<p>It takes one hundred and fifty men, two officers,
ten non-commissioned officers, and sixty horses to
serve, supply and transport the eight small guns,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
one hundred and fifty men trained and inured to
hardship. There is none here who has not been
in several battles and received several wounds in
his active service. There is none here who has
not a good record. When said of one that means
little, but when said of all it is worth telling.</p>

<p>There are artillerymen, cavalrymen, and
sailors who have become foot soldiers through
their different changes; and not only are all arms
represented, but all professions, all classes and
all temperaments. Jacquet, a poet and musician,
a dreamer with an exquisite soul, is an accurate
gun layer. Finger drives milk wagons in Paris,
but with his gigantic hands he manipulates with
delicacy the wheelwork of his Hotchkiss. Millazo,
who behind his counter at Hanoï showed
gracefully the jewels of Indo-Chinese art and
learned at Lure the meticulous art of watchmaking,
now manages a “sweeping” fire as calmly
and accurately as he used to mount a spiral spring
on its microscopic pivot. Corporal Vial, who
used to verify accounts in the luxurious banks on
the Riviera and handle tinkling gold and checks,
here shows that he knows the science of fire and
his machine and leads his squad with authority.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
Charlet drove the heavy locomotives on the railways
of the North; Gamie regulated the powerful
looms in the textile factories, and they both owe
to their knowledge of mechanics their duties as
range takers. Imbert was a fisherman and, as
he knows how to cook a savory bouillabaisse, he
is assigned to the difficult rôle of cook and acquits
himself conscientiously and well. However,
Chevalier, an expert in geometry, who for twenty
years grew pale in profound studies of logarithms
and co-ordinates, here assumes the duties of mess
corporal, and discusses with asperity the supplies
and remarks pitilessly on the regulation cup of
wine and the mathematical pounds and ounces of
mutton, lard and beans.</p>

<p>In spite of what one might think, this odd collection
of men is as homogeneous as could be
imagined. This comes from the fact that above
all this different knowledge is a uniform purpose,
because all these multiple alliances tend toward a
common end which is incarnated in their chief,
a man from the South, who is expansive and impetuous,
but who curbs his temperament under
the rigid calm of a man from the North, one of
the common people, a son of the soil, who has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
risen to the rank of officer, and a commanding
officer at that, solely through persistency and
courage.</p>

<p class="tb">When the lieutenant had finished his rapid but
close inspection, and had examined with the eye
of a connoisseur the condition and repair of the
guns, he took in the whole company with a look,
for it is his work which he commands with firmness
and which he loves. He is already going,
after addressing a few remarks to the adjutant
and the classic, “All right. Break ranks,” when
a man steps out of the ranks and comes towards
him.</p>

<p>“Lieutenant, the company is now completely
equipped and armed, but there is, however, still
something lacking.”</p>

<p>“Indeed,” replied the lieutenant, “and what’s
that?”</p>

<p>“Its marching song.”</p>

<p>“Its marching song! Have you chosen one?”</p>

<p>“Chosen one! Oh, no! We have an unpublished
one, as new as the company itself, composed
for us and created by us. Will you do us
the honor of listening to it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>“Will I? The devil. I ask it; I demand it.
I want to learn it, too. Go on. Start it!” he
exclaimed.</p>

<p>And then Gaix turned towards his comrades
and began to sing in his great deep baritone voice
our marching song, “Ma Mitrailleuse,” which
each section had learned secretly and which they
sang together for the first time to-day.</p>

<p>On a rhythm taken from some war march, some
one had composed simple words, which were
nevertheless image-provoking and vibrant, where
the alternating motet “Ma Mitrailleuse,” sung
in chorus, sounds like a bugle call.</p>

<p>This marching song is one of those which engrave
themselves at once on the memory and in
the heart, which are never forgotten, for in their
accents are rooted the strongest impressions of
the hours lived in the simple brotherhood of arms,
the memory of dangers encountered together, the
pride of victories, and the pious homage to those
who sang it with us and whose manly voices were
silenced forever in the night of battles.</p>

<p>And I find in writing it the same deep stirring
emotion that I experienced when I first
heard it.</p>

<p>When the last accents, sung by the men at the
top of their lungs, died away, there was silence
and I looked at the lieutenant.</p>

<p>He was seated on a staircase, with his head
leaning on his clenched fists. He had listened to
the whole song, and now he remained for a
moment as if waiting. And when he stood up
his eyes were slightly red and his lips concealed
under a smile the impress of intense emotion.</p>

<p>“It is good,” he said, “very beautiful, my
friends, and I congratulate you all. Your song
is admirable, it will go with us everywhere, and
we will lead it to victory. But who is the author?
There must be an author. The devil, there must
be an author!”</p>

<p>There was a moment of silence as if each one
hesitated to reply, but a big sergeant cried out
in a stentorian voice:</p>

<p>“A <i>ban</i> for the author, Lieutenant Delpos, and
a couplet for him besides.”</p>

<p>Then the men broke all alignment, pressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
around their young sub-lieutenant, joyous, proud
and blushing with pleasure, weeping with joy, and
burst out at the top of their lungs, with indescribable
feeling, which showed all their strength,
their will for victory and their unbreakable
confidence:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div>

<p>Then, amidst the applause and the “vivats,”
the lieutenant embraced his young friend vigorously
and said:</p>

<p>“Nom de Dieu! You didn’t tell me that you
were a poet. I congratulate you.”</p>

<p>And taking him by the arm, he went off joyous,
skipping like a gamin, taking up again the inspiring
refrain:</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V<br />
<span class="smaller">A RECONNAISSANCE IN THE FOG</span></h2>

<p>One evening the lieutenant said to me a little
after dinner:</p>

<p>“To-morrow, at four o’clock, we’re going to
the first line trenches to find positions for the
machine guns. The section leaders are coming,
and if you want to come, you’ll find it interesting.”</p>

<p>The selection of a machine gun emplacement
is essentially a delicate task. The Germans are
past masters in this art. So, in the days of attack
when our artillery had made a thorough preparation
and they were convinced that there was nothing
left in front and we could advance without
trouble, exactly as though taking a walk in a
square, we found ourselves abruptly right in the
fire of a Boche machine gun which had not been
spotted and which was so skilfully camouflaged
that it had resisted the most terrible bombardment.</p>

<p>It is necessary above all to find a place which
commands a wide field of fire and one easy to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
play on. It must also be easy to conceal the gun
in some way, for, if it is once spotted, a shell
will soon send the gun and its crew pirouetting
in the air, unless they are forewarned by a shot
too long or too short, but whose destination is
unmistakable, and so have time to move.</p>

<p>It was scarcely daylight when we assembled in
front of the lieutenant’s quarters.</p>

<p>A fog that could be cut with a knife limited our
view to a few yards. It was cold.</p>

<p>Sergeant Lace is there already walking back
and forth in the fog. He is always exactly punctual,
anyway. He is equipped as if for an assault
with his revolver, mask, and field glasses.
His chest is covered with numerous colonial decorations,
his military medal and his war cross with
three palms.</p>

<p>Lace is a section leader <i>emeritus</i>. He is rough
and harsh in appearance; he never smiles, or
rarely; he is tanned from his long stay in the
colonies, but he does his duty with unfailing exactness.
During an attack in Champagne he found
himself under the command of his brother, a lieutenant,
who was mortally wounded at his side.
He embraced him reverently, took the papers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
pocketbook and letters from the pockets of his
jacket, removed his decorations, which were now
relics, and resumed his place in the ranks. He
fought all day, attacked a fortified position, assisted
in the dangerous task of clearing a wood,
and when night came, by the light of star shells
under a hellish bombardment and a storm of
shrapnel, he went back and brought out his
brother’s body and gave it proper burial. Lace
is a soldier and a conscientious one.</p>

<p>Other silhouettes approach and come out of
the darkness like ghosts. One is Poirier, a very
young man, who laughs in the midst of the worst
dangers, which he absolutely ignores. Then there
is big Roullé, whom ten years in the tropics did
not succeed in making thin, and whose breadth
of shoulder is ill-adapted to the narrowness of
the communication trenches. Then Pierron comes
on the run, singing a Neapolitan song. He is
from Saigon and is homesick for the Asiatic nights,
whose charms he is forever describing.</p>

<p>As the hour strikes the lieutenant appears.</p>

<p>We follow the main road through the fog.
This leads to Lehons, a ruined village which is
situated in the lines and cuts the trenches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>One can hardly distinguish the trees in the fields
either to the right or the left. The dawn is silent.
Nature wants light for her awakening, but this
morning the lights persist in staying dim.</p>

<p>We hear occasionally a cannon shot, as sharp
as the crack of a whip. It comes from a battery
of “75’s” concealed in a wood at our side, which
fires at stated intervals for tactical reasons. The
shell shatters the air over our heads and all becomes
quiet again.</p>

<p>So we walk along for nearly an hour, some
grouped together while others dream away by
themselves. The fog now begins to lighten and
we are able to see the adjoining fields. They are
torn with shell holes, the rare trees are shattered
and slashed, and their branches hang down like
broken limbs. In the ditches, full of muddy water,
are piles of material—rolls of barbed wire, eaten
by rust, chevaux de frise broken to pieces, and
crossbars and round logs already covered with
moss.</p>

<p class="tb">Suddenly, there in front of us, at two paces,
splitting the fog is—the village. There are
houses—remains of houses—and parts of walls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
which through some prodigious feat of balance
persist in remaining upright.</p>

<p>The first house on the right was apparently of
some importance. The two master walls still remain
in spite of the roof having fallen. Between
them is a pile of stones, burnt girders, and in the
middle of the heap of rubbish still stands, intact
and rigid, pointing straight toward yawning
heaven, the iron balustrade of a winding staircase.
A great signboard of black wood runs from one
wall to the other, apparently holding them together,
and one might believe that they only remain
upright, thanks to it. It is riddled with
bullets and the flames have licked it as they passed,
but one can still read the long yellow letters of
the inscription:</p>

<p class="center"><i>Lodgings</i><br />
<i>Famous Cuisine</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Comfortable Rooms</i></p>

<p>None of us risk an ironical reflection or a
mocking smile, for to-day we have become accustomed
to so many strange inscriptions which
in disaster are the living lie of their emptiness.</p>

<p>Opposite, on the other side of the road, the
military cemetery shows its multitude of crosses.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
Their number has exceeded the capacity of the
site provided for it, and they have already become
masters of the surrounding fields. These
graves are all immutably alike, and they are built
and maintained with a fraternal affection by companies
of Territorials who hold the cantonments
in the neighborhood.</p>

<p>Yes, they are all immutably alike. There is
always the white wooden cross with the name of
the deceased, the number of his regiment, his
company and the date of his death in simple
black letters. The grave is a small square, bordered
by bits of tile or bricks, sometimes by
planks or the bottoms of bottles. And on this
humble burial place someone has planted primroses.</p>

<p>A bottle stuck in the ground by the neck holds
a bit of paper on which is written all supplementary
information as to identity which will guide
the pious pilgrim of to-morrow.</p>

<p>Sometimes a perforated helmet or a tattered
cap placed on the cross by a comrade who respects
his memory tells us that the soldier was wounded
in the head. One shudders at some of these helmets,
they are rent so grievously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>We pass rapidly but religiously through the
narrow paths between the graves. It is a sort of
duty rather than curiosity which leads us to look
over all these cemeteries in search of some known
name, a friend’s name, so that we may pay our
last respects.</p>

<p class="tb">But time passes. It would not be prudent to
stop longer, for already above the neighboring
hedge we can hear the sinister “ta-co” of the
German bullets. Branches of an apple tree,
lopped off by the shells, fall at our feet.</p>

<p>So we enter the village through what was once
a street. Here for fifty yards are barricades of
bricks and dirt interlaced with farm instruments
and carts.</p>

<p>Barbed-wire entanglements which only leave a
narrow, difficult, zigzag passage between them
are evidences of the bitter fights which took place
here.</p>

<p>We reach the church which is the beginning of
the communication trench which leads to the front
lines.</p>

<p>The church! There is absolutely nothing left
of it. One might think that the savagery of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
German cannon raged with a special hate on the
buildings created for rest, meditation and prayer.</p>

<p>The church has fallen down and the naves are
now only a mass of stones on which the briers are
already beginning to grow. A sort of arched door
still stands at the entrance, without a scratch. It
is nearly new and its brilliant ironwork seems a
challenge in the midst of this destruction.</p>

<p>The communication trench starts on the spot
where the high altar used to stand. We follow
it under the ruins, through the orchards which it
furrows, adjusting our steps to each other, and
keeping our eyes on the man ahead.</p>

<p>Above our heads nature awakes; the sky appears
clear now; and branches of trees with their
buds and blossoms hang over the parapets.</p>

<p>It is five o’clock and broad daylight when we
reach the proposed emplacement. It is on a knoll
in the middle of an orchard which is bordered
some hundred yards away by hawthorn and
privet hedges. Behind the hedges are the Boche
lines.</p>

<p>The engineer in charge of laying out the works
is on the ground. He tries to profit by the only
salient which permits firing on a sufficiently wide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
sweep of ground. On the right it commands the
entrance to the village by a road. We see its
white windings where it unrolls through the gardens,
and then it plunges into a small wood and
loses itself. Opposite us the emplacement commands
an entire sector.</p>

<p>They will scoop out the place underneath, and
they will keep the green shell of grass and bushes
which make the most fortunate and natural sort
of camouflage. A communication trench grafted
on the main trench from the church will give
access to it.</p>

<p>Orders are given rapidly, measurements are
taken, and the tasks laid out. It is hardly expedient
for us to delay in this corner, for our movements
would betray our intentions, and already
bullets, which are by no means spent bullets, cross
above our heads singing their unappreciated buzz.</p>

<p>We make our way back through the trench.</p>

<p>In the village the men belonging to the supporting
columns have left their lairs and are attending
to their usual occupations. Some of them
are washing their clothes in the watering-trough
in the square and singing as they wash. The
company barber is installed near the fountain and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
the men form a circle about him as they wait
their turn. On a butcher’s stall of white stone a
cook is cutting up a quarter of beef into equal
rations. Only two hundred yards from the enemy
the village has taken up almost its usual existence
again. These men are not afraid. At the sound
of the first shell they jump into their cellars, which
are amply protected by earth and boards. But
they already have their customs. Shells only
come at the hour when the supplies are brought
up, and not always then, for the shelling doesn’t
occur regularly every day. The enemy doesn’t
waste munitions on a village he knows is so well
destroyed.</p>

<p>The fresh air and the long road have set our
teeth on edge and given us an appetite. We halt
to break a crust. Some have brought canteens
of wine or coffee; bottles of preserves appear, and
the improvident—I am one—pay homage to
those who pass a full flask.</p>

<p>The sun is already high when we start back
along the road.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">A Poilu</span> <a href="#Page_56"><i>See page 56</i></a></p>
</div>

<p>The lieutenant loves a quick pace and a marching
song. So at the top of his lungs he begins
one of his lively songs full of expressions that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
would have startled a growler of the Empire
through their shamelessness, but which do not disturb
the modesty of a Colonial at all, supposing
that a Colonial ever had any.</p>

<p>And the section leaders take up the refrain in
chorus.</p>

<p>Some steps behind, Sub-Lieutenant Delpos stops
to light his fine Egyptian cigarette. In spite of
the early hour and the uncertain weather, and
with no thought of the disagreeable march through
the sticky mud of the communication trench, he
is dressed with the greatest care. His bright tan
leggings are elegantly curved; his furred gloves
are of the finest quality, and the pocket of his
jacket, cut in the latest English style, shows a fine
cambric handkerchief, subtly scented. And arm
in arm we follow the quick pace of our comrades,
while he continues the interrupted story of his
latest exploit.</p>

<p>“Yes, <i>mon cher</i>, picture to yourself an exquisite
blonde. I met her on the Rue des Saints-Pères....”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI<br />
<span class="smaller">OUR FIRST ENGAGEMENT</span></h2>

<p>Yesterday evening at five o’clock we
received an order to take our positions in
the front line to support the attack which the
second battalion would make at nine-thirty.</p>

<p>It was raining. It has rained all the time for
some months, and we have become accustomed
to the mud and dampness.</p>

<p>We left the cantonment at Morcourt at nightfall.
We went along the towpath of the canal,
across the bridge at Froissy, through the ruins
of Éclusier and entered the communication trench
which we knew as the “120 long.”</p>

<p>The silent march is accomplished with little
difficulty. There is no sound of cannon. Everything
is quiet. We reach our positions about midnight—four
dugouts camouflaged for the guns
of two sections which are to play on the sector; the
two other sections remain in the “Servian” trench
in reserve at the disposal of the commander.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>The lieutenant examines the post established
for him. Farther ahead is a communication
trench which has been completely overturned and
destroyed, now nothing but a great hole. Below
is a big tangle of barbed wire, fascines and ripped
open sandbags. We can see very well through
this jumble and we are installed there.</p>

<p>We can make out the details of the Boche lines
through the glass.</p>

<p>“Come. I think it will be all right. But it
will be hard. Fortunately, it can’t last long.”</p>

<p>Then we return to the positions for a final
inspection.</p>

<p>The emplacements which our guns occupy are
round excavations about three yards across and
two deep. In the middle nearly on a level with
the surrounding ground is a sort of pedestal for
the machine gun. The barrel scarcely reaches
beyond the hole and it is absolutely invisible at
a short distance. The men have proceeded to
make a camouflage which resembles the character
of the terrain with wickerwork covered by dirt
and grass. The many inventions with which they
have increased the weight of the machine guns—the
shield, sights and periscope—are in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
places. The men disdain these additions a little
and even neglect to use them unless forced to
do so.</p>

<p>“They would only have to add a little more,”
they say, “to make a ‘75’ instead of a machine
gun.”</p>

<p>“The periscope may be of use for something.
You have to try half an hour before you can see
anything. I like my eyes better.”</p>

<p>The ammunition wagons are installed and
opened; the belts are ready; the gun layer, the
loader, and the crew are at their stations.</p>

<p>The lieutenant makes the rounds of each section,
inspecting the guns, testing the mechanism,
trying the weight of the munitions, taking account
of everything and looking each man in the face.</p>

<p>“We are the last company organized,” he says.
“You know that the machine gunners should be
the flower of the army; don’t forget it. It is our
first engagement. Try to show that we’re there
a little.”</p>

<p>This short unpretentious harangue produces its
effect on the men, who smile as they listen to it.
They are not nervous now, but only slightly curious.
They are not sorry to put their toys to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
test at last, and to shoot their projectiles at something
besides the moving figures in the training
camps.</p>

<p>When the inspection is over and the final instructions
have been given, we return to the commandant’s
station, and stretch out to sleep on the
reserve caissons which protect us from the mud.
Rifts in the clouds reveal the stars. It will be
fine to-morrow. But waiting is cold, very cold,
and it is impossible to sleep under such a wind.
We talk.</p>

<p>“You’re going to hear a concert. They
haven’t massed more than three hundred guns
in all, from the ‘75’ to the heavy artillery, on
our fifteen hundred yard front for nothing. Have
you seen the ‘150’ mortars? They have some
muzzles.”</p>

<p>Dawn appears. A light fog rises from the
ground and seems thickest at the side of the canal
where the German positions are. It is the coldest
hour of the day and the earth of our dugout is
as hard as iron; it is frozen. Instinctively I let
down the ear-flaps of my cap which until now I
have kept under my helmet.</p>

<p>“Are you cold?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’m not warm.”</p>

<p>“A drop of brandy?”</p>

<p>“Sure.”</p>

<p>The lieutenant passes his canteen to me and
as I drink the thin stream from its mouth I feel
a wave of warmth.</p>

<p>Light comes, but it is very pale. Around us
we hear the tread of feet on the hard ground and
the slapping of arms across the chest.</p>

<p>We wait nervously. Presently we receive an
order not to fire until the blast of the whistle.</p>

<p>Eight o’clock! Behind us, in the limpid azure,
the red disk of the sun rises.</p>

<p>A shell cuts through the air; then another; then
still another. Our artillery is firing on the Boche
lines.</p>

<p>“Attention.” The response is instantaneous.
We can still see no movement in the ranks of the
infantry to our right whose rush we are to support.
What are they waiting for? The men are
nervous and they start to grumble.</p>

<p>Boom! comes the Boche’s reply.</p>

<p>A great mass of earth, grass and crumbled
stones shoots up a hundred yards ahead of us!</p>

<p>Too short!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>Boom! still another. Still short!</p>

<p>A large shell heads for us. It thunders.
Where is it going to burst? The devil! It falls
near our first section, to the left; then, almost
at once, another, a little to the right. Are we
spotted? We haven’t fired a cartridge yet, and
there isn’t an aeroplane or sausage in the air.</p>

<p>Two “150’s,” one right after the other, burst
fair on the section, right in the hole. An enormous
mass of earth spurts up. Through the dust
and smoke we see broken arms, sandbags ripped
open, legs torn from the body, an entire body, the
gun!...</p>

<p>The lieutenant knits his brows in dismay. A
sergeant from the reserve half section, slightly
pale, runs up with the details.</p>

<p>“Sergeant Rollé, the gun layer, and the crew
are killed.”</p>

<p>“Occupy the emplacement with your half-section.”</p>

<p>“Very well, Lieutenant.”</p>

<p>Shells are falling in our sector without a break.
All the guns are splattered with splinters and
most of the crews are slightly wounded.</p>

<p>Durozier’s half section jump out of their dugout<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
in a hurry and throw themselves into the hole
which has now increased in size to a vast yawning
crater.</p>

<p>“If we could only fire on something. But
there’s nothing to see. And no signal.”</p>

<p>The Boche artillery certainly has a grudge
against our first section. The new gun is scarcely
in position when a great shell falls in the same
place, in the same crater.</p>

<p>We see distinctly a body blown high into the
air, and the body still holds the mount of the
machine gun which he was just setting in place.
Headless, disemboweled, it falls just in front of
our dugout within reach of our hands. It is
Gouzé, the chief gunner.</p>

<p>“The <i>salauds</i>!”</p>

<p>An intelligence officer from the major reaches
us.</p>

<p>“Get ready to support the wave which is going
over with all your guns!”</p>

<p>The shells burst on our position implacably.
There isn’t the slightest choice between the emplacements.
Three guns are still intact and ready
to fire at the blast of the whistle. But the fourth
gun must be put in position, too.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>“Tell the adjutant of the section to occupy the
crater,” comes the order.</p>

<p>By means of the half-destroyed communication
trench I reach the section which I find burrowing
in shelters built hastily out of whatever came
handiest and deliver my order.</p>

<p>The adjutant takes it and turns pale.</p>

<p>“All right, but there’s no great chance of our
getting there.”</p>

<p>Their hearts throb, and they look at each other.
It is true that it is necessary, but on the parapet
between the trench and the crater, no longer the
slightest protection, shells fall like hail and without
a let-up. They hesitate.</p>

<p>As if he had foreseen this, the lieutenant had
followed behind me. He reads their hesitation
in their faces and is about to say something to
overcome it when the blast of the major’s whistle
sounds. It is the signal. The wave jumps from
the parallels and dashes forward. We must fire.</p>

<p>Our three guns have already begun their rattle
and are spraying the terrain before the enemy’s
trenches close to the ground, probing the loopholes,
mowing the parapets, and cutting the last
of the barbed wire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>The fourth gun ought to fire too; it must.
Then, quietly, with that unusual coolness which
characterizes him, the lieutenant clambers over
the parapet.</p>

<p>“Will you come with me, <i>Margis</i>?”</p>

<p>Cigarette between his lips, leaning carelessly on
his curved handled cane, as though he were going
for a morning walk through the fields, he advances,
standing very straight, without hurrying, and
without losing an inch of his great height.</p>

<p>The men understand. Five seconds later we
are in the crater and in less time than it takes to
tell it the gun begins to fire like the rest.</p>

<p>The enemy’s artillery has now changed its objective.
It now aims its fire on the assaulting
wave.</p>

<p>We return to our shelter. The spectacle is
wonderful. Almost without losses, our waves
reach the first of the enemy’s lines and clear them
at a bound.</p>

<p>“Lengthen the fire.... On the second position....
Farther ... on the third; on the fortified
emplacement; to the left of the woods....
Fire, fire, fire, nom de Dieu!”</p>

<p>The fire on our sector begins again more violently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
than ever. We have bothered the enemy
and he wants to silence us.</p>

<p>Three out of four of our guns are silent. The
fourth, the last one to arrive, with all the rapidity
of its fire, alone sustains the attack of our
infantry. The wonderful little machine devours
without a skip the endless munitions which the
crew have difficulty in bringing to it.</p>

<p>“Fire, Adjutant, fire! Don’t stop. Give it to
them,” shouts the lieutenant, seized by the fever
of battle.</p>

<p>And the adjutant fires, fires without stopping.
Our wave reaches its objective, the enemy flees,
whole companies surrender.</p>

<p>“That’s it; we are there. Fire on the reserves,
farther, the length of the embankment.
Cease firing, stop it, stop firing. We are there....
Cease firing!”</p>

<p>Just as he shouts this order a shell, the last one—the
third on the same spot—falls, bursts, and
buries the gun and its heroic crew.</p>

<p>“M ...! The swine! Can’t they see that
it is finished?”</p>

<p>Heavily and mournfully we make toll of the
dead. Comrades pay their last respects to their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
comrades. They take their letters and keepsakes,
and arrange the bodies for their last resting place
as best they can.</p>

<p>The order to go back is given.</p>

<p>For two hours we make our way through the
communication trench, now only a stream of mud
in which we sink to our ankles.</p>

<p>We advance, dejected, silent, heavy with
fatigue, depressed by the thought of those we
have left behind, whom we shall never see again,
as was our wont, even yesterday at the cantonment.</p>

<p>The lieutenant is in the lead, leaning on his
baton, silently, chewing on his eternal cigarette.</p>

<p>We finally reach the end of the trench at
Froissy and come out on the main road.</p>

<p>In spite of their long hours of fatigue and the
sleepless nights, the men suddenly seem less weary.</p>

<p>They no longer march one on top of the
other, stepping over corpses. Their horizon has
broadened; they see; they breathe; they come out
of their trance; they emerge from Hell, they come
from death. They are coming back to life!</p>

<p>Two hundred yards ahead we can already see
groups: our mules, our limbers, companies of
Territorials who are repairing the roads, sappers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
from the engineer corps, men from the field
kitchens, automobiles, dreams ... the living
world at last.</p>

<p>The sub-lieutenant has remained at the rear of
the column, assuming the difficult task of encouraging
the stragglers and keeping up the spirits of
the weak. Now he runs up and down the ranks.
He is proud of his men; he loves their swagger
and steadiness.</p>

<p>“Come, children, a little speed. Try to march
by these people in some style.”</p>

<p>And as we approach the first huts he begins to
sing at the top of his lungs his song, the song of
the machine gun:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse"><i>Mais dans le petit jour blémi,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Alerte! Voici l’ennemi!</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Et t’éveillant soudain rageuse,</i></div>
<div class="verse indent3"><i>Ma mitrailleuse,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Avec tes tac tac réguliers,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Sans t’arrêter, noire et fumeuse,</i></div>
<div class="verse indent3"><i>Ma mitrailleuse.</i></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Some of the men look at him in surprise, look
at him and then begin to sing.</p>

<p>And this bruised troop, which had just lost
half its effective strength, with its wounded men
with their bloody bandages, their torn clothes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
their arms in bits, filed by singing this heroic joyful
song, expressing in their voices all their hopes
and all their triumphs.</p>

<p>It defiled between lines of astonished men who
stood respectful, stupefied at so much energy, so
much fire and dash in the face of so much death.</p>

<p>In position before his staff, fingers together in
the prescribed position of salute, a general stood
with bared head, while the company marched by.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII<br />
<span class="smaller">EASTER EGGS</span></h2>

<p>Easter—it fell on April twenty-third that
year—dawned splendidly, a real day of
gladsome spring.</p>

<p>The company was off duty. We had worked
for a month on the fortifications in the front-line
trenches and we deserved this fine day.</p>

<p>In addition the sector was quiet. There hadn’t
been an engagement or a skirmish since February.
This large village—more than a village, a town
almost—scarcely five miles from the Boche lines,
absolutely unprotected, not concealed in the slightest
by a bend in the terrain, by a hill or a wood,
had not received a single shell in three months.</p>

<p>Of course it is true that the church, town hall
and some factories were injured, but not very
much. They had some large shell holes, but they
hadn’t fallen in or tumbled down. The church
and town hall still had their roofs, and if the
chimneys of the sugar refineries were cut on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
bias, it was high up, almost at the top, as if they
wanted to blunt them, or spare them, or preserve
them.</p>

<p>We were now accustomed to this incomprehensible
calm, in fact the officers were often heard
to say,</p>

<p>“This quiet bodes no good to us.”</p>

<p>All day and nearly all night, too, we hear the
shriek of French and Boche shells in the air. Batteries
of heavy artillery search for their marks,
but all that misses us and passes over our heads
or strikes in front. We know that they aren’t
aimed at us, and we take no interest in them. So
with that fine carelessness of men long since accustomed
to the worst dangers, we live in absolute
security.</p>

<p>That Easter morning a musical mass was sung
in an immense great hall which had been used formerly
for entertainments. A crowd of soldiers of
every branch of the service and from all the regiments
encamped in the neighborhood packed the
place. In the crowd was a goodly number of civilians,
including women and girls who were wearing
their best dresses for the first time in a year.</p>

<p>The band of the ... first Territorials played.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>Someone beside me dared to murmur,</p>

<p>“All the same, if a Boche shell fell in that
crowd, what a mess it would be!”</p>

<p>“Don’t think,” came from several sides at
once, “about Boche shells. They fire them.
They know we are here. They are afraid—”</p>

<p>The chaplain, assisted by two clerical stretcher
bearers, began worship on the improvised altar
on the stage.</p>

<p>Soldiers sang the psalms of the liturgy.</p>

<p class="tb">I was nervous, and sobs came to my throat. In
order not to make a ridiculous spectacle of myself
with my tears I went out. I ran to the cantonment,
saddled my horse, and we galloped at random
through the sunny country on paths covered
with flowers. I stopped in the depths of a valley
under the poplars and stretched out on the grass.
My horse laid down beside me. And while he
munched the grass entirely indifferent to me, I
said:</p>

<p>“Kiki, old Kiki, if an unexpected shell fell on
us now and blotted us out, that would be much
less disastrous than if it fell among those who at
this hour are praying in that chapel. They are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
praying for their faraway firesides, their mothers,
their wives.</p>

<p>“They are praying for the preservation of the
past and for the future. They have the joy of believing,
and that belief, that faith, has steeped
them in a special life to which they remain
attached.</p>

<p>“But we, old horse? If a shell annihilates us,
what of it?</p>

<p>“We have never believed anything and we
never will.</p>

<p>“I have impressed my brutal scepticism on the
beings who are nearest and dearest to me. I
have torn down the faith of their cradles ... a
faith in the Beyond.</p>

<p>“So when we shall be under the sod sleeping
our long night, before next spring has awakened
its green verdure on our remains, base and nameless
oblivion will already have overtaken us. On
the simple white cross my hastily traced name
will not even be read....</p>

<p>“Perhaps in passing near my abandoned grave
someone will say, ‘Poor fellow!’ Perhaps someone
more sentimental than the rest will throw
flowers on it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>“But in disappearing, old horse, we shall harm
no one.</p>

<p>“The tears on the beautiful eyes I know so well
will at first be bitter, but they will be dried at
last.”</p>

<p class="tb">This rather melancholy monologue was not to
Kiki’s taste at all. He interrupted me by whinnying
loudly. He knew it was time for oats.</p>

<p>So we went back to the cantonment under the
fine midday sun. Before our door at the last
house on the left, on the road to the sugar refinery,
Burette, the quartermaster-sergeant, was going
through his matutinal ablutions. He generally
began them about eleven, just as they were calling
dinner, which made him twenty minutes late and
gave him a chance to growl about the cooking,
which was not hot enough to suit him, or about
his share, which, according to his appetite, was reduced
to a proper allowance.</p>

<p>Inside, seated before an open canteen which
served him equally as a seat or a writing desk,
was Adjutant Dotan reading and re-reading and
sighing over the letters he took from a voluminous
package in front of him. In a loud voice he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
mused over the problem which haunted his days
and nights:</p>

<p>“Shall I marry? Or, shall I not?”</p>

<p>For two years now Dotan had seen the realization
of his matrimonial projects grow further and
further away from week to week, from month to
month.</p>

<p>On the first leave the Regimental Administrative
Council had not acted on his request. Then,
for two consecutive times, leave was stopped on
the day before he was going to go. And despite
the advice of the colonel, to whom he told his
grievance, Dotan would not marry by proxy.
This ceremony <i>in partibus</i>, entrusted to a third
party, seemed to him the least bit ridiculous, and
he had a well-developed desire for the whole of
the wedding ceremonies.</p>

<p>“Shall I marry? Or, shall I not?”</p>

<p>While he thought over his dilemma, he read
for the hundredth time the letters from his gentle
fiancée, who awaited him in Provence. And he
occupied the monotony of the long hours in writing
her two letters a day, one in the morning and
another in the evening, with sometimes a supplementary
postal card in addition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>“To think that if I were married I should have
already been so happy!”</p>

<p>“Three days,” Morin let fall cynically in his
innocent voice.</p>

<p>“Yes, I should have been happy.”</p>

<p>“Three days,” insisted Morin, “the second
day before, the day before, and the day of your
wedding until noon. And then you wouldn’t be
as you are now—free, tranquil, and without a
care.”</p>

<p>“Free, tranquil, without a care! Oh, yes, you
say. You’re always the same. Free, tranquil
and happy! You must have learned that by looking
out of your window, you, say....”</p>

<p>Morin, in accordance with his parsimonious use
of words, did not want to carry on this tedious
discussion. He would have answered, nevertheless,
had not Dedouche announced that the table
was set, and that there was a wonderful menu, a
real Easter menu.</p>

<p>Chevalier, the mess corporal, both our Vatel
and cup bearer, had come back from leave the
day before. Before our ravished eyes he untied
his packages, spread out sumptuous, epicurean
dainties, and drew from their thick straw covers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
generous bottles of wine whose very appearance
made us joyful.</p>

<p>Morin had been a constant guest at the select
restaurants of La Cannebière and at the famous
inns of La Corniche, and is an expert in the art
of opening a fine wine without shaking it, and he
also knows how to carve roasts and chickens skilfully
and symmetrically.</p>

<p>He was opening with suitable impressiveness
an old bottle of Sauterne, whose bright golden
color brought smiles to our faces, when a tremendous
explosion brought us to our feet and
threw down the single partition in the room.</p>

<p>“The gun back in the garden draws the fire,”
mumbled Dedouche with his mouth full, and without
letting go of his plate which he was rubbing
carefully with a large bit of bread.</p>

<p>But as he spoke a still more violent explosion
shattered all the window panes in the house to
bits.</p>

<p>A great Boche shell had fallen thirty yards
from us in the street which had been recently
covered with hard flint and which it scattered into
innumerable fragments. We heard the cries of
the wounded and the dying outside.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>“Quick! Into the cellar!”</p>

<p>But none of us lost our heads sufficiently to
take refuge in the cellar without our munitions.</p>

<p>One brought the fowl, another the bottles, a
third the sauce, and someone the cheese and
candles, and under the threat of shots which
speeded us we reached our underground shelter.</p>

<p>The light of two candles stuck in bottles showed
us the table in the darkness and we spread out
our dinner things anew.</p>

<p>Above was the bombardment in all its intensity.</p>

<p>Shots landed in the road level with our air-hole,
which, as a provision against such an occurrence,
had long since been stuffed with sandbags.</p>

<p>We heard things falling!</p>

<p>“<i>Mince!</i> what are they offering us for Easter
eggs?”</p>

<p>This ready joke made us laugh, and we forgot
the tragedy of the hour. In the heady anesthesia
of real Pommard, and not christened “Pommard”
for use at the front, but which had a real
Burgundian bouquet, we forgot that the shells
were raging in all their fury above us.</p>

<p>The shadow of a man appeared at the entrance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
to the cellar. Illuminated by the wavering yellow
lights of our candles, it stood out in sharp contrast
in the darkness of the staircase.</p>

<p>“Is the margis here?... Margis, the lieutenant
says you are to bring all the horses at once
to the gulley in the Caix woods and shelter them
from the bombardment.”</p>

<p>“All right, I’m coming. Go on, Dedouche,
pour out another glass of Pommard. I’ll take
my dessert in my pocket.”</p>

<p>I picked up my helmet, mask and cane and was
ready to go, as I listened through the vaults and
hoped for a let-up in the storm.</p>

<p>“It’s over. We can go.”</p>

<p>“When you wish, old fellow. They’ve stopped
for breath.”</p>

<p>“You’ll find out in five minutes.”</p>

<p>“Bah! I’ve more time to go than I need.”</p>

<p>“Good luck, and if you find any Easter eggs
on the way bring them back for dinner.”</p>

<p>The adjutant’s reiterated joke no longer had
the same zest for me and it hardly made me
smile.</p>

<p>Outside, the streets were empty, and there
wasn’t a soul in sight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>The bombardment had stopped, but no one
was taken in by this deceptive calm. From one
moment to another we waited for a new bombardment
even more violent than the first. The
Boches are creatures of habit and this is not the
first time they’ve played this trick. When they
bombard a cantonment, they very often interrupt
their bombardment some minutes so as to make
us think it is over; then, when the men have
ventured into the streets, they suddenly begin
again and make fresh victims.</p>

<p>A house has fallen in the middle of the road
some steps from our cantonment. Débris block
the way, and we have to climb over them. Farther
along, at the other end of the street, a house
which was still intact this morning is now in
flames.</p>

<p>There is no time to lose. Already several
shells, advance messengers of the coming storm,
begin to fall. I was about to dart across the
Place when a “105” fell on the pavements and
burst.</p>

<p>A poor little soldier carrying two enormous
bags, a great bundle of linen, and some souvenirs
in his hands passed just then. He was on his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
way to the station at Guillaucourt to take the train,
for he was going on leave.</p>

<p>Rejoicing in his approaching happiness he
walked on without paying the slightest attention
to this atmosphere where death was hovering.
A shot hit him in the back and passed out the
other side. I jumped to aid him. He was bathed
in blood. In a gentle, caressing, almost timid
voice he said to me:</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s not painful. I am dying.”</p>

<p>And then with his lips, with an expression of
kindness and thankfulness which I shall never
forget, he murmured, “Yvonne.” ... And his
face haloed with blessedness like the religious
images of the martyrs, he died.</p>

<p>I stood there in ecstasy, transfixed, before that
beauty in death, before that strength of love
which lights the final hour.</p>

<p>How many I have seen die in this way! In
their last breaths all had the name of some woman,
and their eyes lighted at the name.</p>

<p>In the final moment of a life which is going
out physical suffering no longer counts. The
name of the loved one embodies all the vanishing
mirage of the future, the end of a too beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
dream, the memories of a happy past ... of a
happy past, for the bad times are forgotten.</p>

<p>Before the quivering body of this poor little
soldier, struck down fiercely just as he was going
on leave, full of hope, of plans, of dreams, a
song on his lips, I forgot the threatening shells.
An artilleryman went by on the run and shouted
at me:</p>

<p>“Get out of that. You’ll get done up.” And
I fled.</p>

<p class="tb">Our horses were bivouacked in the courtyard
of a sawmill. Not an accident there. I counted
them all at a glance.</p>

<p>The underground shelter of the men was in
the back of the yard, and I went to the air-hole
which was stopped up by a piece of sheet-iron
which served as a screen against splinters.</p>

<p>“Oh, down there! Men of the echelon. All
outside. To horse. We must hurry. Come on,
hurry up! Your masks, helmets, forward with
just the bridle!”</p>

<p>One by one they jumped out of their lairs,
grimacing as the bright sun struck them full in
the face as they came out of the darkness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>“Each one two horses, by squads of six....
One hundred yards between each squad. The
other men will remain here and mobilize the
pack saddles and caissons in the cellar. Take the
road to the Caix station ... on the road lined
with poplars.... On the gallop ... no
straggling.”</p>

<p>Some minutes later we were already going out
of the village. It was a bad passage, but the
only one and the shortest one to reach our destination,
but three hundred yards had to be covered
on entirely unprotected ground opposite the
Boches.</p>

<p>Boom! It was the expected. The shells began
to fall again. A cloud tinted with red from the
tiles of a falling house rises in the air and makes
a large spot in the sky back by the church.</p>

<p>Boom! There’s another one now and nearer
to us, near the sugar refinery.</p>

<p>A crash, an avalanche of bricks; this time it
is the chimney of the sawmill which falls on the
horses’ cantonment. It was time, five minutes
sooner and we would have been under it.</p>

<p>“Go on, go on.... Gallop, for God’s sake.
Corporals ... keep the distances.... Spread<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
out the squads.... Get into the fields ... behind
the trees.”</p>

<p>We reach the deep path like a whirlwind, while
the bombardment rages over the village more than
ever.</p>

<p>“Any accident? Anyone hit? Good. Assemble,
and on the trot now.”</p>

<p>Ten minutes later we are in the shelter of
Muguet wood, completely shut off from the view
of the Boche artillery.</p>

<p>The wood deserves its name, for it scents the
air a hundred yards about with the perfume of
violets and lilies of the valley, which form a carpet
between the trees and which our mules, entirely
insensible to the subtle beauties of nature,
begin to eat as though they were common fodder.</p>

<p>“Corporals ... look to your sections....
Is everyone here?... All the horses too?”</p>

<p>I cast a rapid glance over the parked beasts.</p>

<p>“Look, Liniers, where is Chocolate?”</p>

<p>And indeed where was Chocolate?</p>

<p>How did it happen that Chocolate wasn’t
there?</p>

<p>Still he had been with the rest at the sawmill.</p>

<p>Chocolate, as the veteran of the echelon, received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
special consideration from the men. As
far as the dispositions of the cantonment permitted,
they reserved for him a covered shelter,
a feeding rack, and a manger.</p>

<p>This time the sawmill offered many resources.
The stable walls still stood with only a few gaps,
and the roof was still intact. Beside some artillery
horses, who were generally absent, there was
an available place and they had given it to Chocolate.
And there the drivers had forgotten him.</p>

<p>If it had been any other animal we would have
let him go, but Chocolate was an entirely different
matter and we must go and find him.</p>

<p>“Raynal, I hand over the command of the
detachment to you. Liniers, come with me, we’ll
go and find Chocolate.”</p>

<p>We went back over the path, on foot this time,
but as fast as our legs would go. As we reached
the village the intensity of the bombardment
seemed to decrease. Were we going to be lucky
enough to strike another lull? Again there
were particularly violent explosions, nearer, then
nothing more.</p>

<p>We reached the village entirely out of breath.</p>

<p>As we turned into the street which led to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
sawmill Liniers stopped suddenly, as if petrified,
and began to wave his hands.</p>

<p>“M ...!”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“The shed....”</p>

<p>“Well, what about the shed?”</p>

<p>“Demolished. Can’t you see? It’s gone.”</p>

<p>We ran still faster.</p>

<p>The shed was absolutely demolished and is
now only a shapeless mass of rubbish, but there
are no signs of a shell—no traces of burned
timbers, no splinters. One would have thought
that it had folded up and laid down on its side
like a house of cards.</p>

<p>When we reached the shed we saw Chocolate’s
great neck and shoulders and enormous head free
from the rubbish which hid the rest of his body.
He was stretched out full length on his side,
browsing serenely on the young shoots of an
apple tree, which had gone down with the building.
His large eye looked us over as we stood
there, overcome and absolutely stupefied with
amazement, as much as to say:</p>

<p>“What ... you’ve come at last ... you
needn’t have been in so much of a hurry.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>I ran to the air-hole of the cellar.</p>

<p>“Hey there, men with spades; quick, come, dig
out Chocolate.”</p>

<p>“Dig out Chocolate!” and they all rushed out
utterly surprised by the announcement of such a
job.</p>

<p>The bricks were scattered with a few blows of
the shovels, the beams raised, and the place cleared
away.</p>

<p>With all the ease of a circus horse who has
been playing dead, Chocolate stretched out his
front feet, then his hind ones, balanced himself
two or three times, took a spring, and without
the slightest hurry stood up, shaking himself all
over like a dog coming out of the water.</p>

<p>There were a few scratches on his hide, but it
was an old hide, hard and tanned, which resists
everything. Nothing broken! Brave Chocolate,
come on! The men all look at him, admire him,
and fondle him. He seemed somewhat surprised
by such manifestations of great affection.</p>

<p>And without a care in the world for the bombardment
which was beginning again, he went to
the nearby pond and drank deeply.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII<br />
<span class="smaller">THE AEROPLANE</span></h2>

<p>Dawn had just broken. Some of the boldest
of the men in the echelon were already
up, rubbing down their horses and adjusting the
breast collars. At daylight we had to go a long way
to exchange the pack-saddles for munition-wagons.</p>

<p>This has been the way from the start. The
companies of machine guns, probably even more
than the other branches of service, although I
don’t know, are experiment stations on which they
try one sort of gear one day and another the next.
First it is a round shield, then a square shield,
and then a periscope. We adopted the Wikers
saddle, only to have it replaced with the Hotchkiss.
And we had scarcely put it in service than
it was withdrawn to give us ammunition wagons.</p>

<p>These changes are one of the slight distractions
of the trade. They must distract still more the
handlers of the public funds to judge by the frequency
they offer them to us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>But what difference does it make to us whether
we do one thing or another? While we wait time
passes and the war goes on.</p>

<p>And then “there’s no use trying to understand.”</p>

<p>That is the typical expression in every army.
Before the most unexpected orders, the most unusual,
which seem the most useless and incoherent,
we can only bow without trying to use our intelligence.</p>

<p>“There is no use in trying to understand.”
That’s the whole secret of discipline. If one did
try to understand, he would never obey—or too
late.</p>

<p class="tb">We were ordered to assemble on the Place at
daybreak, and at daybreak we were there. The
clear sky is splendidly luminous.</p>

<p>“Good weather for aeroplanes,” said someone.</p>

<p>Indeed it was good weather for aeroplanes,
for there wasn’t a cloud in the sky and no mist
on the ground. A reconnaissance in such weather
should be easy.</p>

<p>The Boche aviators are early birds. One sees
them but rarely during the daytime, when ours
mount guard on the lines, but their specialty is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
getting up early in the morning. We hear them
flying over our cantonments long before daybreak,
at the first rays of dawn, and see them returning
rapidly to shelter as soon as the light becomes
clearer and it becomes easier to fire our cannon
and machine guns.</p>

<p>Presently, as I am giving a final inspection to
the material we are to turn in, I meet Sergeant
Lace in the yard of the sawmill.</p>

<p>“Oh, but you’re an early bird to-day.”</p>

<p>“I’ve just been ordered to find a good place
to fire on aeroplanes and take up my position there
at once. There’s going to be a section there
each day. Mine starts.”</p>

<p>“Have you found your emplacement?”</p>

<p>“Not yet. But that’s not hard to find. Just
a hole or a sloping place, so that we can stretch
out on our backs.”</p>

<p>“I know just the place for you. The hole
of a ‘320’ at the entrance of the village on the
left, near the poplars. You’ll see it right up
against the fence which borders the road from
Caix.”</p>

<p>“Wonderful. I’ll take up my position there.
It must have been dug expressly for me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>A half hour later the cavalry of the three
machine-gun companies of the regiment assembled
in front of the church.</p>

<p>Cavalry!...</p>

<p>My good comrade, Roudon, a sergeant-major
in the Hussars, who is now with the first company
of machine guns in a position like mine, becomes
furiously angry every time he hears that word
“cavalry.”</p>

<p>“Cavalry! Cavalry!” he roars. “You ought
to say an assery, a mulery. Just look at them.
Not one in ten stands up on his feet. And the
riders! There isn’t one who could ride a horse.
They’re afraid!”</p>

<p>Roudon is an experienced cavalryman. For ten
years he knew the mad, intoxicating dashes with
the Algerian contingents in Morocco, the mysterious
attractions of reconnaissances in the long
reaches of the valleys of the Sahara, impetuous
charges and wild triumphant pursuits among the
red Spahis with their Damascus swords, amid the
glistening sands which rise toward the sun in
golden spangles. At the beginning of the war
he was thrown into a regiment of metropolitan
cavalry and fought in Lorraine and Belgium. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
lived through the horrible hours of retreat, assuming
the perilous mission of rearguard while
the other regiments withdrew in good order. He
fought on foot, in the edges of woods, to stop
to the last moment the march of the enemy while
the rear went on to the Marne. He endured
those long, seemingly endless, waits on foot in
front of his horse, the bridle on his arm, saber
in scabbard, under the storm of shells and the
invisible menace of bullets. There were no
trenches then.</p>

<p>Roudon is a cavalryman in his soul and his love
for the service. So, attached to an improvised
service which is neither cavalry, artillery, nor infantry,
he does not know what to make of it,
and he rages at it through his excess of conscience
and too exclusive love of duty perfectly done.</p>

<p>The echelon of the third company arrives on
the Place in good order a few seconds after us.
Hémin leads it and he marches on foot beside his
column, hands in his pockets, whistling.</p>

<p>Hémin is a type, and not the least interesting
among the complex personalities of our command,
for we are cavalrymen transformed into infantry,
but we’re still cavalrymen just the same.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>Hémin is as much a cavalryman by trade as
Roudon, and perhaps even more so. He was
successively a stable boy in a racing stable at
Chantilly, then a jockey, and finally a trainer,
after he had done his military service in a regiment
of chasseurs. So he is a horseman par excellence.
But he never made war as a cavalryman
before. Since the beginning of the war he
has been attached to various services. First, he
was an infantry scout, a standard bearer for a
general, a courier for a major, and he was transferred
to the companies of machine guns when
they were definitely established. Hémin has a
style all his own. To all appearances he is neither
a cavalryman nor a foot soldier. His jacket is
a Colonial one with anchors and cuff-facings, but
it has white stripes. He wears great yellow boots,
a cavalryman’s spurs, his breeches are reinforced
with olive leather, and his head is covered with
a very small black cap. Another curious characteristic
is that Hémin, the excellent horseman,
always walks when he accompanies his detachment.</p>

<p class="tb">When we are assembled, we turn the command
of the detachment over to Roudon, the senior<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
officer, and he leads the way. Hémin and I bring
up the rear some distance back.</p>

<p>In files of two our one hundred and fifty horses
and mules form a long column, unwieldy and
slow, which winds along the road.</p>

<p>“A fine target for an aeroplane!”</p>

<p>This exclamation had hardly been uttered when
the well-known roar of a Boche aeroplane was
heard over our heads.</p>

<p>“Zut! there’s one.... We ought to have
expected it in such weather and started earlier.
Look out, if he spots us. Don’t worry, there’s
no danger, he’s too high.... At least three
thousand.”</p>

<p>A “75” was already weaving around this
scarcely visible, extremely mobile target the white
tufts of its shrapnel, and threw around the machine
a murderous circle which followed it in its
evolutions. But the aeroplane in the air seemed
to care little and it continued on its way.</p>

<p>We all followed the vicissitudes of the fight as
we went along, heads in the air. When a shell
seemed to burst very near, an exclamation came
from every mouth.</p>

<p>“Oh!... that didn’t miss much.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>“A little more to the left; that would get
him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that missed.... He’s too far.”</p>

<p>“This is outrageous ... he’s gone ... he’s
getting away.”</p>

<p>And as a matter of fact the aeroplane gets away
... outside the “75’s” field of fire. It guides
itself no doubt by the white ribbon of the road
which shows clearly against the rich green of the
pastures.</p>

<p>He has seen us now. He has seen us crawling,
winding and unrolling on the ribbon. He heads
straight for us, circling around in circles of which
we are without a doubt the center, and gradually
comes lower.</p>

<p>“Look out for the bombs.”</p>

<p>“No ... he’s half turned ... he’s going
back.”</p>

<p>“Going back.... You’ll see.”</p>

<p>He’s lower now and we can see distinctly the
great black crosses under his wings.</p>

<p>All our men are looking. The horses seem to
scent the danger, for they prick up their ears and
paw the ground, while the mules neigh.</p>

<p>Suddenly from on high something begins to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
glide along some aerial rail and shatters the air
above us. That lasts a second, a flash. As we
listen and wait one would have said that it falls
slowly and for hours. We look in the direction
of the noise as if to see something, as if to see
where the bombardment is going to fall. It seems
like a linked chain which rolls out, clashing its
links against each other.</p>

<p>A tremendous boom, and black smoke, greenish
and red as well, blacker, denser, thicker than that
from the great shells, rises in the middle of the
field a hundred and fifty yards on our right.</p>

<p>And there is another. It bursts on our left at
the same distance. He is certainly searching for
the range. Will the next strike in the middle and
right on the mark? We’re a fine mark, to be
sure, a fine target,—one hundred and fifty horses
in Indian file. If he doesn’t make a good shot
he’s a duffer.</p>

<p>Roudon stands up in his stirrups, turns around,
and shouts commands to the uneasy men:</p>

<p>“Close up, close up, close up, I say.... Dress
up together.”</p>

<p>He leads the column rapidly, now closed up into
a compact group like a flock of sheep, towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
the road from Harbonnières, which is lined with
trees that will conceal us from the aeroplane.</p>

<p>Two other bombs burst behind us one after
another.</p>

<p>“That makes four. He can’t have many left.
He didn’t bring a truck!”</p>

<p>Some hundred yards away near a pond cows
graze absolutely indifferent to the battle in the air.
The “75” again begins to fire. Its bursts of shrapnel
come close to the aeroplane but do not hit it.</p>

<p>Another bomb. I stop. It looks as though
it were going to fall in front of us. I’m not going
to put my head under the knife. So I start to
draw my horse back under the trees.</p>

<p>There it is. It has fallen in the fields again.
But its explosion throws up dismal fragments,
large and bloody ones. It fell squarely on the
herd of cows and annihilated it.</p>

<p>“The bungler! He’s wasting the milk,” comes
in the accent of the faubourgs nearly under my
horse’s feet.</p>

<p>Hard by, in the hole of the “320,” Lace’s half-section
has placed its battery. I had approached
it without seeing it as I drew back under the threat
of the bomb.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>“Say, how long are you going to let him do
that?” I ask.</p>

<p>“Let him do it!... You don’t mean that,
Margis. He won’t blow on his sauerkraut this
evening.”</p>

<p>“Wait and see what sort of a menu we’re going
to serve that ace.”</p>

<p>It was Grizard, an actor in the suburban
theaters, speaking. He looks like the best natured
and quietest of men, but he is a pitiless pointer
who never lets his prey escape.</p>

<p>“Let me play a little, Margis. See how pretty
he is, how fine, and how well he flies. It is too
bad, a pretty little canary like that.”</p>

<p>“Ah! Attention, ladies and gentlemen. Two
turns, and at three we will commence. You’ll see
what you will see.”</p>

<p>“On with the music.”</p>

<p>And the music begins the dance. First, come
slow shots, rhythmic and irregular tac-tacs, spaced
like the prelude to a slow waltz. Grizard
is searching for the tune; then, gradually, he
accelerates the time, and the tac-tac becomes
faster.</p>

<p>Now he has the aeroplane in his field of fire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
... the bullets dance around him in a ring of
fire, without a break ... the dance of death!</p>

<p>And the circle grows narrower and narrower,
infernal, pitiless.</p>

<p>Everyone looks; there is nothing to see up there;
bullets are elusive and invisible, but we make out
the drama.</p>

<p>From his rapid evolutions, his sharp darts back
and forth, his irregular and hurried spirals, we
understand that the aviator has already been
reached but is trying to baffle the fire which pursues
him.</p>

<p>The tac-tac continues. It is incessant, implacable,
ferocious. The silence of death hovers over
men and things. All Nature seems to await the
issue of the combat which is no longer doubtful.</p>

<p>I look at Grizard. Hand on the handle of the
gun, he follows the evolutions of the aeroplane;
his eyes shine as at a good trick he is playing on
the acrobat up there, and softly, with all the desired
expressions, as if he were before his audience
at Belleville or at the Gaîté-Montparnasse,
he hums:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>“He’s hit,” Sergeant Lace cries suddenly.</p>

<p>And indeed he is hit.</p>

<p>The wings waver, bend, warp, and abruptly
fall in a spiral, while an immense burst of flame,
which the speed increases immoderately, rises and
marks the limpid blue of the sky with a long red
thread which dissolves in the heavens in a trail
of gold.</p>

<p>With a noise of broken iron, tearing canvas,
explosions which recall fireworks, the machine
smashes into the fields, right where the last bomb
had destroyed the peaceful herd of cows a moment
ago.</p>

<p>We run from all directions, but there is nothing
to see. The aeroplane was completely destroyed
by the fall and the fire, and ends by burning
itself up.</p>

<p>It is impossible to get the charred body of the
aviator out from the smoking ruins.</p>

<p>Grizard is on the scene with his gun crew, and
examines his target.</p>

<p>“Good shot!”</p>

<p>We congratulate him and begin to go back.
But Grizard is a comedian who knows his business
and who has perhaps played a rôle in the circuits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
in faraway provinces, and he is not a man to miss
an effect.</p>

<p>He stands by the roadside in the courteous attitude
of Cyrano de Bergerac pointing out the way
to the Count de Guiche after amusing him for a
quarter of an hour. And Grizard, who has
amused us for a quarter of an hour, but in another
way, points out the road and says:</p>

<p>“The quarter of an hour is past, Messieurs. I
release you.”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX<br />
<span class="smaller">DAYS IN CANTONMENT</span></h2>

<p>The regiment is holding the first line
trenches in front of the La Vache woods.
When the company is in the lines, the echelons,
the war train, and the clerks remain behind in the
cantonment at Morcourt.</p>

<p>Morcourt is a delightful little village hidden in
the green meadows under the poplars on the banks
of the canal of the Somme. Morcourt was once
a hamlet of one hundred and fifty houses and
their flower gardens, but to-day it is a real village
where there are crowded together a population
of more than ten thousand men. More than
twenty thousand horses are bivouacked in the
neighboring villages of Proyart, Lamotte, Bayonvillers,
which have no water, and they come to
Morcourt twice a day to dry up the watering
places.</p>

<p>Our quarters here are in the open fields.
Everybody can’t have covered shelters. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
major of the cantonment showed us the field and
said,</p>

<p>“Try to make shift with that.”</p>

<p>And we did.</p>

<p>Less than an hour later the grass was mowed,
ground down by our haltered horses, who devoured
it with their sharp teeth.</p>

<p>Beyond, on the edge of the road, in impeccable
alignment our sixteen ammunition wagons are
parked.</p>

<p>Behind are the horses, the huts of the four sections
of the echelon, and the war train.</p>

<p>And at the end the four large caissons of ammunition
and the munition wagons.</p>

<p>Burette and Morin, the clerks, cannot make a
simple tent do. More comfortable quarters are
necessary for their work.</p>

<p>After a day of hunting around Burette came
back to camp, radiant.</p>

<p>“<i>Mon vieux</i>, I’ve found something wonderful.
We’ll live like princes.”</p>

<p>“Where did you get it?”</p>

<p>“Some fine people. It’s next to the mayor’s.”</p>

<p>“<i>Mince!</i> You look well. Did they offer you
the house?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>“You’ll see. It’s better than that.”</p>

<p>“Better than that!”</p>

<p>We stamped our feet in impatience. Such a
windfall is worth while. If we stay here a whole
month we shall be well lodged.</p>

<p>I was already rejoicing in the thought of being
able to build a comfortable bed.</p>

<p>Saux, on whom devolved the delicate and most
often difficult care of our getting moved, foresaw
innumerable conveniences.</p>

<p>Morin alone remained sceptical. He is that
temperamentally.</p>

<p>He sees no good in this north country. He has
been morose ever since he left Provence, and
he won’t smile again until he hears tinkle in
his ravished ears the familiar evocative sonorities
of Avignon, Arles, Miramas, Le Pas des Lanciers,
L’Estaque. The sun, the blue sky, the
blue sea!</p>

<p>And how right Morin is!</p>

<p>The sun exaggerates, but in openness and
beauty. The fogs are deceitful.... Far better
to be dazzled than deceived....</p>

<p>Morin distrusts the splendid cantonment of
Morcourt. He knows those at Proyart, Chuignolles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
Minacourt, Virginy ... and others
besides....</p>

<p>Oh, for the commonest hut, the most modest
cabin, ruined though it be and sordid, but haloed
in the sun, flooded with clear light, bathed in the
silver foliage of the olives, planted down there on
the rocks of Pointe-Rouge or of L’Estaque, beside
the sea, sheltered in the valleys of Camions,
or perched on the hills of Allauch! How much
better it is, how much better worth living in, than
the most sumptuous castles buried in the damp
forests where the stones are green under the moss.</p>

<p>High on a hill on the road to Harbonnières
opens the courtyard of a farm.</p>

<p>Burette leads us there in triumph. It is his
discovery. He crosses the court, and opens majestically
a small low door, with a barrel on
each side in which stunted geraniums vegetate
miserably.</p>

<p>It is an old pig-sty!</p>

<p>Scraped and washed with a lot of water, it will
be habitable. We’ll make something out of it.
Burette borrows a long table and at once covers
it with his innumerable account books. We make
our beds against the walls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>Thirty ammunition caissons placed in double
rows, a mattress stuffed with hay, a tent cloth,
two covers—that’s our camp.</p>

<p>The corner at the back falls to Morin. It is
the longest way of the room and he can stretch
out his whole tall form at his ease, which he rarely
finds it possible to do in the cantonments.</p>

<p>Night reserves various distractions for us.</p>

<p>First, the rats.</p>

<p>The rats descended from the dove-cote in a
dense horde and made incursions on our haversacks,
in mad gallops over our bed clothes—gigantic
rats with interminable tails!</p>

<p>They used the open space between the beds as
their lists and had real battles, biting, crying and
moaning. The routed fugitives jumped over
Morin’s body to get to shelter and he shivered in
terror.</p>

<p>Burette decided to try extreme measures, for
hunting them with shoes has no effect. So he
begins to sing one of the most beautiful tunes in
his repertoire called “A Montparnasse.” It must
have thirty verses, all ending in an interminable
“nasse ... nasse ... nasse.”</p>

<p>It seems that it was a triumph of the boulevards,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
and no true lover of songs should be ignorant
of it. Very possibly.</p>

<p>The rats must have shared my opinion, however,
for they seemed to like the great triumph of
the boulevards only moderately, but they remained
quiet while the song lasted.</p>

<p>That song had another virtue, too. It put me
to sleep and Burette as well. His voice dragged
more and more, and grew more feeble, when a
terrible cry pierced the night.</p>

<p>Morin shouted in terror.</p>

<p>We jumped for our electric lamps.</p>

<p>Their dim rays brighten the darkness.</p>

<p>Above Morin’s head, through a hole in the mud
wall which separates us from the neighboring
stable, a calf—a young calf—gracious and
smiling, has stuck his great red head, and has imprinted
a caress on the face of our sleeping friend
with his milky tongue.</p>

<p>“The salaud! He has bitten me,” grumbled
Morin, wiping off the dribble which stuck to his
face.</p>

<p>“Get out, animal.”</p>

<p>But the calf was insensible to this harsh invitation.
He continued to endure the flashes from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
our lights with a placid eye, and, drawn no doubt
by Burette’s song, which seemed to him like familiar
news, he began to bellow, waking up the
whole stable, and the cows added their powerful
voices to that of their offspring.... We slept
no more that night.</p>

<p class="tb">The days which followed were not all exactly
alike.</p>

<p>The lieutenant sent us word by a cyclist to come
and see him in the lines and get the list of changes
to be made among the men and horses.</p>

<p>We started at daylight and went in the company
wagon as far as Froissy. When we got
there, Morin told me that he knew a wonderful
short cut which avoided the great détour by Éclusier,
and led directly to the communication trench.
Walking in the wet meadows where we sank in
up to our ankles had little attraction for me. I
preferred the hard highway and the towpath, but
Morin knew the country and claimed that we
would only have several hundred yards of bad
walking and then we would reach a practicable
path.</p>

<p>We walked more than an hour. The fog grew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
thicker and thicker, limiting our horizon to a few
steps. There was never anyone in sight.</p>

<p>“My dear Morin,” I said, “if your short cut
is as wonderful as you say, it must be known. But
at the moment it seems somewhat deserted to me.”</p>

<p>Morin did not reply. There was no doubt that
he wasn’t certain of his way, but he did not dare
to admit his mistake.</p>

<p>The weather inclined one to melancholy.</p>

<p>We walked on in silence. The path was very
narrow and we were obliged to walk one behind
the other.</p>

<p>A sinister grumbling seemed to shatter the
heavens above the fog.</p>

<p>Instinctively we hurled ourselves to the ground
into the wet grass and mud.</p>

<p>The shell passed over us and buried itself in the
ground without exploding.</p>

<p>“This quarter hardly seems the safest in the
world, Morin.”</p>

<p>“They’re firing on the battery of ‘75’s’.”</p>

<p>“A battery of ‘75’s’? What battery?...
Where have you seen a battery?”</p>

<p>Although he was seriously disturbed about our
direction, Morin would not budge.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>“It was there day before yesterday. It must
have moved.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you’re sure your short cut hasn’t
changed its place.”</p>

<p>I had scarcely spoken when a shell followed the
direction of the first and exploded beside us,
throwing up a mass of mud, grass and water.
The ground was soft and unfavorable for deadly
splinters. In any other terrain we would have
been hit seriously.</p>

<p>This time Morin hesitated,</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I’m mistaken!...”</p>

<p>“I was sure of it a long time ago.”</p>

<p>“Let’s go on just the same; this must bring
us out somewhere.”</p>

<p>“That’s my opinion, too.”</p>

<p>The fog was still heavy. We walked in a cloud
the length of an interminable trench recently cut
in the clay. The bottom was full of water. It
leads us in an unknown direction. How can we
find out what way we are going? Where are we?
We follow its windings for half an hour and
clamber over crossings. Perhaps we’re going
around in a circle. The mist is about us all the
time. We can see nothing. Not a landmark.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>In the distance far to the north, in the English
sector, a heavy gun hammers the air with loud
regular shots. We started out at daybreak to
go ten miles. It is ten o’clock now and we have
no idea where we are.</p>

<p>I get impatient and begin to grumble.</p>

<p>The air becomes fresher, and a fairly strong
breeze comes up. In a few seconds the blue sky
reappears above our heads.</p>

<p>In front of us forms stand out—trees, shattered
trees, stretching their dead branches like
broken arms, and seeming to cry to heaven in entreaty
for the martyred earth.</p>

<p>“The La Vache woods!”</p>

<p>We are in the La Vache woods within sight of
the enemy’s lines. Thirty yards from them! We
are on the further side of the trenches, where the
terrific storm of shells rages daily. We have the
honor of being the finest target that will ever be
offered for a shot with a grenade.</p>

<p>We throw ourselves flat, but the embankment
overhangs the lines so much that even crawling is
only a moderate safeguard.</p>

<p>“Nom de Dieu! I’ll remember your short cut!
To go to the Boches it’s the best ever!...”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>We slide along on elbows, stomach and knees
like snakes, which puts our clothes to a severe test.
And we let ourselves fall head first into the “Servian”
trench, just over the lieutenant’s sap, who
cannot believe his eyes when he sees us fall as
from the moon.</p>

<p>“Where did you come from?”</p>

<p>“We’ve been taking a walk in the La Vache
woods. Does that mean anything to you?”</p>

<p>“How did you come?”</p>

<p>“By a short cut!... a fine short cut, you
know. I recommend it to you!”</p>

<p>Sub-Lieutenant Delpos was making his rounds
in the sector and was told of the exploit. He is
nervous and in a murderous humor, for he spent
a sleepless night on a special mission between the
lines. So Morin caught it a hundred times worse
than he deserved. Sub-Lieutenant Delpos’s moments
of ill humor are, like some storms, violent
but quickly over. The adventure ended with an
excellent cup of coffee, flavored with XXX brandy,
which he offers us in his sap, sumptuously furnished
with every possible comfort, twelve yards
underground.</p>

<p>Towards midnight I went down to Éclusier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
through an English observation trench. It is only
accessible at night. In the daytime a Boche machine
gun is placed on the other side of the Somme
and enfilades it. It is suicide to venture there.
Cut out of the rock in the hillside, its ridges are
short and steep. It is a bad trench, but an important
short cut.... Saux should be waiting for
me with the horses in a ruined house behind the
church.</p>

<p>Éclusier is a hamlet on the left side of the canal.
There is a single street with ragged houses on each
side, but they are not badly ruined. The church,
protected by a bend in the cliff, still has its steeple
intact through some prodigy of equilibrium, although
the roof has fallen in. At the side, in what
was once the presbytery, is the regimental dressing
station.</p>

<p>Lights come and go.</p>

<p>Men are coming back from fatigue duty,
searching for their dugouts by feeling for them.
Through the air-holes, from which come odors
of cooking, one can see lighted cellars.</p>

<p>I make my way by the aid of my electric lamp
through this labyrinth which was once a street,
and I find the house. I guess at it, rather, from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
the pawing of the horses, which are nervous and
are pounding on the flagstones. It is an old
grocery and its sign still reads: “Fine Wines—Desserts—Choice
Preserves.” A ragged green
cart cover takes the place of the door. I raise it.</p>

<p>A gust of foul air hits me in the face, and I stop
on the threshold gasping for breath. I see Saux
asleep, his head on my saddle, and rolled up in
horse blankets. Burette is asleep beside him.</p>

<p>Burette, the quartermaster, spent three months
in the heavy artillery. He is an enthusiast on
horses, but his equestrian ability is far from
equaling his love for it. His style produces many
falls, but they don’t discourage him.</p>

<p>I wake up Saux, who gets up dizzily. Is he
half drunk, I ask myself. That’s not like him
at all.</p>

<p>“Look, Saux, what’s the matter?”</p>

<p>But Saux leaned against the partition, searching
for the door with his haggard eyes. He
dashed outside seized by nausea. The noise woke
up Burette, and he too got up with difficulty.</p>

<p>“Say, what have you two been up to?”</p>

<p>“Oh, <i>mon pauvre vieux</i>, I don’t know, but I’m
sick.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>“The fact is there is considerable of an odor
here; you might have found a better....”</p>

<p>The horses are troubled by it, too. Kiki jumps
about and paws furiously. Burette’s and Saux’s
horses are sleeping heavily and their breathing
is difficult and oppressive.</p>

<p>There’s something wrong somewhere, although
the enemy hasn’t sent over any gas.</p>

<p>With the aid of a light we poke about in the
dark. I see a pile of canvas in the corner of the
room which is oozing with dampness. I raise
the bottom of the canvas with my stick and a
swarm of great flies comes buzzing out around us.</p>

<p>There are the bodies of German soldiers abandoned
for no one knows how long. Weeks, perhaps;
since the attack on Fries without doubt.
The blue swollen flesh is spotted by bites made
by the teeth of rats. They are rotting and filling
the soil with purulent matter.</p>

<p>With their monstrous faces, sunken eyes, cheeks
fallen in, and their mouths convulsed by their last
struggles, they seem still to shout with the fright
of their last hours. Burette and Saux have slept
beside this charnel-house.</p>

<p>We lead out the horses in a hurry and saddle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
them in the open air. We gain the hard towpath,
the only practicable way, and go on at a lively
pace.</p>

<p>The first light of dawn appears. At the bridge
at Éclusier we stop a minute before climbing into
the saddle. The Territorials there offer us a
cup of coffee. It warms us, for the morning fog
on the Somme is always cold.</p>

<p>“To horse!”</p>

<p>I decide to go at a good pace as far as the
bridge at Froissy and take the lead. We must
get along before the towpath is encumbered by
all the loafers of the companies which are resting
in the huts along the length of the canal.</p>

<p>A battery of “75’s” in position near the military
cemetery at Cappy is firing shells.</p>

<p>We pass very close to some guns as they are
starting off. Coquet is frightened, jumps, and
dashes into the fields, heading straight toward the
hedges of some vegetable gardens.</p>

<p>“Attention! Burette, pull on the bits.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be afraid. He knows me.”</p>

<p>He knows him so well that Burette had scarcely
spoken than Coquet stopped short before the
fence. Burette went over alone, head first, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
landed in the vegetables. Fortunately, the ground
is soft, but in hurdling the obstacle he bumped
into some bushes, and gets an eye bruised and a
cheek scratched.</p>

<p>“That’s nothing. That’s all right,” he says.</p>

<p>He remounts his horse, laughing and singing:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse"><i>Ah! les p’tits pois, les p’tits pois,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>C’est un légume très tendre.</i></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He can appreciate them this time.</p>

<p class="tb">We meet Hémin, our comrade of the third
company of machine guns, at Froissy. He came
out at dawn with orders from his commandant
and is going back to Morcourt, and we go along
together.</p>

<p>Going from this bridge to that at Méricourt,
the towpath is almost deserted. Hardly anything
crosses our path except some English motor-cyclists.</p>

<p>Hémin is riding a superb charger, a great long-legged,
bright chestnut, who carries his head
proudly—a fine beast.</p>

<p>Some yards away from the branch from Neuville
marines from the gunboats have planted huts
along the towpath between the poplars.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>The regular trot of our horses sounds clearly
along the way.</p>

<p>A marine hears us and raises the flap of his
tent to see us.</p>

<p>This frightens Hémin’s horse and he jumps into
the canal.</p>

<p>Our comrade is unhorsed and disappears under
the water. We jump down. But even before we
jump two marines have plunged in. Others poke
around with poles in the mud from a boat. In
an eddy a hand appears, then a head, swollen,
bloody, crushed.</p>

<p>Hémin got a blow from a shoe full in the face
and could not swim.</p>

<p>The body is brought on to the bank.</p>

<p>A surgeon from the gunboat doubles his efforts
in vain.</p>

<p>Hémin is dead.</p>

<p class="tb">We buried him in the little cemetery at Méricourt
one Sunday morning.</p>

<p>It is the ideal cemetery of the poets, hidden
in green from every sound. Each grave seems
alone in a thicket of lilacs and honeysuckle. No
scientific gardening here; no trees butchered by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
experts; no cultivated flowers; no bombastic marbles.
The grass overruns the paths; the simple
flowers of the field have blossomed on the graves,
thus bringing in every season the natural homage
which returning life pays to the dead.</p>

<p>Nature is pleased to shut every sound from this
field of rest.</p>

<p>At the end of a lane, at the foot of a willow,
we lay Hémin to rest in his last sleep.</p>

<p>The men of the echelon come, the major, a
captain, and the officers who knew him particularly
well. The intelligence officers of the three
companies joined in buying a wreath and came
to the services together.</p>

<p>Hémin’s captain speaks a few words. It is not
the time for a long talk, for a simple touching
farewell is sufficient.</p>

<p>And before he goes each one throws in the
grave the symbolic bit of earth.</p>

<p>Sad duty!</p>

<p>Before the grave is filled in I drop over him
petals of peonies....</p>

<p>Poor fellow! He is not the most unfortunate.
He is in that luminous land of day and knows
what we are powerless to know. He has finished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
with our poor human troubles, and on him have
fallen the curtains of his last resting place.</p>

<p>But those who are left, his wife, his child!...
That is where sorrow begins. They don’t know
yet, and for a long time they will know nothing
and will live in anxiety.</p>

<p>To-day, at the very hour perhaps, when we let
him down in his last resting place, his wife received
the letter he wrote her yesterday morning.
She read this letter to her child, this letter in
which he announces his next arrival on leave,
where he said to her,</p>

<p>“In a week or two I shall be with you without
a doubt.” He never will be now, or, rather, he
is there already, for the immaterial presence of
loved ones accompanies us, if it is true that they
are loved and are not forgotten.</p>

<p>And pensively, under the fine rain which is
falling, we return to our cantonments.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X<br />
<span class="smaller">AN ORDINARY FATIGUE PARTY</span></h2>

<p>This evening the first section has to go on
the works. The men have eaten earlier
than usual, and they are on the road before
nightfall.</p>

<p>The column remains in good order to the end
of the cantonment, but once across the passage
by the knotty elm at Harbonnières, it breaks ranks.
Each one goes along as he likes, talking or alone.</p>

<p>There is madness in the air. We prefer another
order of things than to spend one evening
out of two in the first line digging in the mud.</p>

<p>“Rather the trenches where we can snooze in
peace,” they say.</p>

<p>The column trails along. Pierron, the sergeant
who leads it, pays no attention. With Millazo,
a tradesman from Hanoï who has arrived just
recently, he talks of Indo-China, of Saigon, and
their gardens.</p>

<p>We had scarcely arrived at the end of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
sunken road which opens out on an uncovered
slope on top of a ridge than a well-known whistling
shatters space. Each of us throws himself on
the ground, in a ditch behind a tree, and the shell
passes over us in the air.</p>

<p>“That wasn’t meant for us.”</p>

<p>Then another, still another, and dozens like
it; we count up to sixty.</p>

<p>“M ... what are they having at Proyart for
dessert?”</p>

<p>That is all the concern they have about what
is going on in the rear, or about the havoc and
death the bombardment is launching at this moment
on the cantonment where their comrades
live. That is the egotistical indifference which
long experience with danger gives, and the constant
contemplation of death. The column
marches along more carefully and wider awake,
concealing themselves from the view of the
enemy’s aerial observers which are to be seen
high on the horizon in spite of the late hour and
the twilight which has already begun to grow
dark.</p>

<p>“Do you suppose they’ve forgotten the
sausage?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sometimes they stay out to give us a shot.”</p>

<p>So we wait until it is very dark before we reach
our position in the works.</p>

<p>The place where we have to dig is in the front
lines. We have to construct circular dugouts for
machine guns, with their rounded platforms, and
to connect them with the trench by underground
trenches.</p>

<p>We climb over the trench carrying our tools
in our hands and slip between the barbed wire,
but we have scarcely gone a yard when a heavy
fusillade warns us that this time we are spotted.
We dig in.</p>

<p>“Is anyone hit?”</p>

<p>No reply, no groans; everyone is there, flat,
stretched out. We wait flat in the grass and the
mud until the star shells fall, and as soon as one
has, and before the following one has scaled
through space and lighted it with its dim light, we
jump into the hole which the fatigue party of
yesterday dug.</p>

<p>But the tools aren’t idle, although we guess
rather than hear the blows of the pick digging
in the deep rich earth and the shovelers throwing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
it out as far on the parapet as possible so as not
to form a salient.</p>

<p>We dig for hours without interruption, lowering
our heads in the holes as the star shells go
up, and taking up our tasks as soon as it is dark
again.</p>

<p>The enemy has discovered the time of our
fatigue parties, and to-morrow it will know the
exact position of our work, so that it will be
somewhat uncomfortable to continue. It must
be finished to-night.</p>

<p>A company of Territorials is stretching barbed
wire on our right.</p>

<p>Between each star shell we can hear the hammering
of the sledges against the stakes, the strain
of the tension on the wire, and when the traitorous
light shines again these wonderful workers
don’t even hide. They remain hanging on the
barbed wire, motionless and disjointed like corpses.
They look so much like them that the enemy
doesn’t even fire, as he feels certain that he has
annihilated this gang which heroically continues
its gigantic task.</p>

<p>“Look!... they’re like statues.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>“One would think it was a party ... there
are the lights and the orchestra.”</p>

<p>The time for supplying the company in the lines
comes. The men of the field kitchens come by
groups of three or four from the trenches just
behind us.</p>

<p>The first two have a long rod on their shoulders
and rolls of bread on this. Others carry in canvas
pails and kettles come from nowhere the coveted
wine and the aromatic brandy. Others bend
under the weight of pots which hold lumpy black
bean soup, which splashes out at every jolt in the
path. It is already cold and greasy. Finally, the
mess corporal reaches the end of his trip and
draws out of his sack the desserts bought with
the mess balance and the commissions given to
him the day before by the men in the trenches.
The pockets of his jackets are full of letters he
has just received from the officer with the mail,
and which he delivers to the men who have been
waiting for them hungrily.</p>

<p>When he gets as far as the fatigue party he
stops and hesitates. He must go over a space
of fifty yards, absolutely exposed, to the edge
of a group of trees where there is a first-line<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
trench taken from the Boches in the last attack
and not yet connected with the communication
trench.</p>

<p>He has reason for his hesitation, for the last
two days the Boche trench on our left has been
firing on it heavily.</p>

<p>Day before yesterday an entire fatigue party
was killed. We can see there in front of us the
abandoned sacks and scattered packages. Five
men out of eight were killed yesterday. The
others were able to get over some of the provisions
and the bad news by crawling, and at the
price of a thousand risks. They also took the
rest of the provisions from the bodies of their
comrades who carried them. To-day they advanced
the time of bringing the supplies an hour
in order to foil the enemy’s vigilance. This time
the mess corporal accompanied the fatigue party
himself to discover, if possible, a less perilous
mode of communication. But the Boches must
have been on the watch, or guessed or got wind
of it somehow. The star shells now follow each
other with no let-up, lighting up the road so that
one can’t venture on it. Under this too persistent
light the Territorials abandon their simulation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
corpses and seek shelter in the trench to which
we are getting ready to return.</p>

<p>It is necessary for the supplies to go on. The
company in the front line has had only insufficient
provisions for two days.</p>

<p>The mess corporal is a brave man and makes
several attempts to venture outside, but each time
he is received by a fusillade and only has time
to throw himself backward in the trench.</p>

<p>The fatigue party has been watched and waited
for.</p>

<p>We hold a council of the non-commissioned
officers and the lieutenant of the Territorials
which has held the position for several weeks.
Various stratagems are proposed and we weigh
the chances, but after consideration all of them
are vetoed. It is impossible to get by even at the
greatest speed without risking the lives of several
men, and perhaps of all.</p>

<p>Still, if we were able to draw the attention of
the Boches, to occupy them with something else,
to enfilade them, to shell them.</p>

<p>“Enfilade them ... shell them....”</p>

<p>“Isn’t there some place from which we can
enfilade them?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>And we all considered in our minds the position
of the Boche trenches.</p>

<p>“We can’t do anything from here,” said a sergeant
who had spent various periods in these
trenches for several months, and knew every corner
of it; “but below there to the left, about a
hundred yards from the picket post, is a ruined
cabin which dominates everything. But there’s
nothing doing in getting there; it’s too near;
they’d see us as plain as day.”</p>

<p>One of our men heard all this. And while the
conversation went on, I saw him climb up on the
parapet and examine the position.</p>

<p>It was Marseille, an impetuous, headstrong
type. He rebelled at all discipline, he was restive
under observation, but his bravery was unfailing,
and he was absolutely oblivious to danger, which
he ignored with a swagger and indifference which
seemed amazing. Marseille has known one hundred
thousand adventures and turned one hundred
thousand tricks, and has always come back
absolutely unharmed.</p>

<p>When he was on his last leave he spent six
unrestrained days in innumerable drinking bouts
in all the bars at La Cannebière, where he narrated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
his boasted deeds of prowess, which were
probably much inferior to the real ones. Then,
instead of going back, he waited for them to come
and get him. He was arrested on the eighth day
and brought back to the Corps by the provost.
Marseille was not the least upset when the officer
demanded the reasons for his delay, and replied:</p>

<p>“I don’t like to travel alone. I like society, I do.
So I have had a whole car to myself and my escort.
And besides, I knew very well that the gendarmes
wouldn’t come from Marseilles here without buying
a drink, and they wouldn’t have the nerve to lap
it all up without offering me some. I like the gendarmes.
That may seem strange to you, but I do.”</p>

<p>Marseille is a good singer and his number
appears in all the company concerts. His throat
is as clear as the sunny lights of La Corniche and
L’Esterel, and he can render the final trills of
the Neapolitan songs with the best.</p>

<p>When he had finished his rapid observation he
came back to our anxious group and spoke to
the mess corporal:</p>

<p>“You’ll be all right, <i>mon vieux</i>. You’ll get there.”</p>

<p>And we all looked at him in open-mouthed surprise
at such assurance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>“Have you any news or an idea? Explain.
Tell us something about it. Let us see.”</p>

<p>“You’ll get there, as I told you. Don’t bother
about those fellows over there. That’s my job.
Watch me.”</p>

<p>And to the lieutenant who was getting ready
to question him:</p>

<p>“You have a machine gun, haven’t you, Lieutenant....
Won’t you lend it to me ... just a
minute? It’s a Saint Etienne. I know that....
I know them all.... They’re all the same....
And five belts with it to amuse the Boches for five
minutes.... That’ll be enough for the cooks
to get over.”</p>

<p>We understood it all, and we laughed and admired
him. Marseille rolled up the barrel of the
machine gun and the belts in several thicknesses
of canvas, tied a rope to it and attached the other
end to his wrist.</p>

<p>“Hold on to the package so that it won’t make
trouble on the stones, and when I pull on the rope
twice, let it come.”</p>

<p>And he crawled out of the trench and slid down
towards the ruined hut.</p>

<p>We waited anxiously the full ten minutes. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
watched the cord unroll with varying emotions.
It stopped, stood still, immovable. Has he
arrived?</p>

<p>Then we felt the two jerks, and the lieutenant
let the heavy package slide, and it got mixed up
in the stakes, rocks, and gullies, and made such
a metallic noise that it could not help attracting
the Boche’s attention. And it had an effect. The
enemy believed that we were making some sort
of a movement, and launched in our direction a
heavy fusillade which we refrained from answering.</p>

<p>Again ten minutes passed ... they were
interminable.</p>

<p>Then suddenly came the machine gun ...
ours ... Marseille’s.</p>

<p>Slowly at first, it sent out its irregular tap-tap,
then the cadence became faster, and then a steady
crackle. The Boches were taken in the flank and
thought that we were making an attack, and Marseille,
who saw them running by the light of their
star shells, shouted out,</p>

<p>“Forward, the cooks, run, nom de Dieu!”</p>

<p>The fatigue party rushed out at top speed.
Soup spatters from all sides. The rations of wine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
and coffee will be short. The men disappear in
the wood. They are over; they are safe.</p>

<p>Now the German bullets are raging to our left
about the hut; rockets go up asking for artillery.
In front of our lines close to us explosions rock
the ground. Their artillery is firing in the right
place. The fatigue party is over but the Boches
have another prey. By this time Marseille is
stewing away in the ruins of his shelter.</p>

<p class="tb">While the shelling lasts we discuss his last feat,
safe in the sap, while we munch the last of our
cold repast. Then, as dawn begins to appear and
we have to return to the cantonment at daybreak,
we begin to get ready to go. Before we go we
share a bucket of wine which the overloaded
fatigue party couldn’t carry in its dash and
abandoned.</p>

<p>But a shadow stands before us in the sap.</p>

<p>“So they share their leavings and there is none
for the hungry?”</p>

<p>It is Marseille, safe and sound, whole, without
a scratch. Everyone crowds around him, and the
officer runs up.</p>

<p>“And now, if you’ll pull in that string, you’ll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
bring back the tools. I’m sore on that machine.
You know, Lieutenant, that gun wasn’t our
Hotchkiss. I had to dismantle the breech; it
jammed at once. I couldn’t have fired more than
half a belt. Fortunately, they gave me light with
their star shells; I couldn’t have done it without
them.”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI<br />
<span class="smaller">WITH MUSIC</span></h2>

<p>We are in reserve cantonments at Chuignolles,
and we all lodge together at the
end of the village, near the church, in a large
house, which isn’t injured much and which once
served the servants of the presbytery. We were
shaken up in our last action, and they give us
comparatively generous liberty, no manœuvres, no
reviews, and no drills. The section leaders have
seen to the arms and ammunition and have secured
an entirely new equipment from the ordnance
officer.</p>

<p>The infantry have turned gunners over to us to
fill up our ranks.</p>

<p>The lieutenant recommends the men to distract
themselves with games, gossip and songs.</p>

<p>At his solicitation we organized a concert, several
concerts, in fact. Each section has its artists
which it believes in and of which it is proud.</p>

<p>One evening in the garden adjoining the officers’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
quarters we were endeavoring to draw out
the meal by chatting, but conversation flagged as
night drew near. So Sub-Lieutenant Delpos, who
was opposed to dreaming as engendering melancholy,
demanded a concert at once, immediately.</p>

<p>The cantonments were scattered about in the
surrounding gardens.</p>

<p>“Croharé,” he said, “run to each section and
bring back artists—all the artists in each company
must be here in five minutes.”</p>

<p>And five minutes later they were there. All the
company, too, for each section followed its artists,
who were to shine in all the glory of their repertoire
before the officers and the “little staff.”</p>

<p>We had singers, comedians and speakers, professional
and amateur. Jacquet gave with exquisite
artistry several delightful songs, the words of
which he had composed and adapted to well-known
tunes. The “Lettre à la Marriane” was really
touching.</p>

<p>Gaix and Corporal Vail sang with real talent
and gave us a full repertoire from the operas.
The indefatigable Marseille gave, in a hilarious
gibberish, an Italian-Marseilles thing which
brought down the house with wild laughter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s too bad we haven’t a piano to play the
accompaniments,” said someone.</p>

<p>“A piano! I’ll attend to that,” said the ever-resourceful
Chevalier. “Four men in my bunch,
and I’ll bring it at once.”</p>

<p>Some minutes later the party brought in an
enormous harmonium which it had found in a
room of the presbytery. That harmonium had
been the silent witness of famous battles, had been
taken and retaken with the village. It had played
“Die Wacht am Rhein” under the German heel,
the “Rêve Passe” with the artillery, “Sidi-Brahim”
with our Blue Devils, and it was still in
good condition and almost all the notes played.</p>

<p>“And now we have a piano, we must have a
player.”</p>

<p>“Oh, there, ‘Father Music.’ You know this
is your job. You played for us last summer in the
church at Minaucourt.”</p>

<p>“Father Music” smiled gravely and pushed
his way through the groups.</p>

<p>A candle stuck in the neck of a champagne
bottle and placed on the harmonium lighted up
his Christlike face with a golden light.</p>

<p>He seated himself, without stopping smiling,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
on a pile of ammunition caissons which served as
a piano stool, and—honor to whom honor is due—since
we are machine gunners, he begins the
“Song of the Machine Gun,” with Gaix singing
the first stanza.</p>

<p class="tb">“Father Music” stands out in the light in the
middle of the dark night and this group of a hundred
men who one surmises are there, rather than
sees, squatting on the grass around the instrument.</p>

<p>Under his cap thrown back on his head the hair
shows sparse and thin, his beard is large and
tangled, and he smiles through his large, clear
eyes. His lips move with the singer, and he sings
the song with as much fervor and composure as if
he were chanting a Halleluiah.</p>

<p>“Father Music!” ...</p>

<p>He is a fine figure in our society, rich in epic
types.</p>

<p>I have seen him near us for some weeks, as
much in our echelon as in the company of which
he assumes the duties of infirmary orderly. I
have learned to know him, and to know him is to
love him.</p>

<p>By scraps, by fragments of phrases, for he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
speaks but little—little of himself, but instead
launches out in real flights of declamation about
an idea, a poem, a well-known tune, the names of
artists—I have been able bit by bit and through
deductions almost to reconstruct his life.</p>

<p>He is a quiet man in all his ways, habits and
ideas. He lived in the quarter of Saint-Sulpice in
an old house in the quiet Rue Madame, and made
his living by giving music lessons in the institutions
in the neighborhood.</p>

<p>They knew him in the quarter as “Monsieur
Placide.” On the appointed days at the same
hours he went to the Nuns of the Immaculate
Conception, to the Brothers of the Sacred Heart,
or to special lessons in the city, without ever wandering
far away from the quarter, in the old venerable
houses, in the Rues d’Assas and Garancière.</p>

<p>On Sundays he played the organ in a small
chapel of the Visitation Sisters.</p>

<p>The people knew little about him through social
intercourse, for he never went out, or rarely. In
summer he sometimes went to the Tuileries to
listen to secular music—and that is all.</p>

<p>When in August, 1914, the notices of mobilization
called all able-bodied men to arms, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
orders were to join a regiment of Colonial infantry
in a fort around Paris.</p>

<p>This man lived a regular life apart from dangerous
contingencies, and was unacquainted with
worldly ambitions and political strife, but he went
to war knowing nothing of it, and considering it
only a little and then through a professional view-point,
as a sort of great drama in which he was
going to play a comparatively passive rôle.</p>

<p>Under the cap and great coat of the infantryman,
bristling all over with equipment, he was the
typical “poilu”—the poilu of tradition. His
large beard covered the front of his brown coat,
and this gave him the proud appearance of a
veteran.</p>

<p>At first he was going to sacrifice this thick beard
which he had spared since his liberation from his
regiment, but his officers wanted him to keep it.
That brought him a place at the head of the company
on the march, and he drew all eyes. He
was the poilu.</p>

<p>His reputation as a musician who played on any
and all instruments was quickly known throughout
the cantonments. So he was at all the ceremonies
and all the merrymakings. In the morning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
on a harmonium carried to an open field he
might accompany a military mass said by stretcher-bearers,
while that evening he might play on a
chance piano, perhaps on the same harmonium,
at improvised concerts, accompanying jolly, broad
songs sung by amateurs and playing the national
hymns of the Allies, and astonishing even himself
in the patriotic choruses.</p>

<p>And this man to whom everything that was not
classical or the Gregorian chant was strange, who
for twenty years of his life had taught successive
generations Méhul, Gluck, Bach, Mozart and
Beethoven, to whom Massenet, Delibes and
Gounod seemed profane, surprised himself by
pounding out on a badly-tuned piano and singing
with all his might the refrains of “Viens Poupoule,”
popular marches, and the ballads of the
faubourg.</p>

<p>The soldiers had quickly named him “Father
Music” and this nickname pleased him immensely.</p>

<p class="tb">That night an order came from the commanding
officer:</p>

<p>“Two companies of machine guns will go with
the utmost haste to Hill 174, northwest of Herbècourt,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
to stop the enemy which is trying to outflank
our right.”</p>

<p>At three o’clock in the morning we were at the
position indicated.</p>

<p>A small chapel with a cross was situated on the
top of the hill. The open space in front commands
the road which descends gradually toward
the Méréaucourt woods where the enemy is
concealed.</p>

<p>We fortify our position in a few minutes. On
both sides of the road a gun sweeps the slope and
the approaches and guards the way out of the
woods. In the little belfry which is shaped like
a dove-cote another gun commands the woods
and can disturb evolutions in the wood itself.</p>

<p>We use the material at hand to fortify our
emplacements—bits of benches, a door of a confessional,
and the railings of the chapel.</p>

<p>At our right across the road a company of riflemen
also establish entrenchments, so well camouflaged
that the enemy cannot see them until in its
zone of fire, that is to say, too late.</p>

<p>The officer, a young sub-lieutenant, asks us not
to fire until he gives the signal. He has the
idea—and a good one—to let the enemy advance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
and come up the road. Here he would be
unable to execute a converging movement and
our gun in the belfry would sweep the right side
of the road and prevent his turning aside, the
company of riflemen would protect the left, and
his section of Grenadiers would attack on the
road.</p>

<p>We are confident of the strength of our positions
and our means of resistance, and we wait
for the launching of the attack without anxiety.</p>

<p>“Father Music” has organized his dressing
station in the chapel in the shelter of the altar
and now wanders around the building.</p>

<p>The church recalls familiar surroundings to
him and he delights in looking at it. There are
a few simple frescoes, pictures of the Crucifixion,
where gigantic men stand out in relief against
a background of microscopic mountains and Liliputian
houses, and they interest him.</p>

<p>He lets his fingers wander over the keyboard
of the harmonium which lies forgotten in the
choir.</p>

<p>His comrades jeer,</p>

<p>“‘Father Music’ is going to play our <i>De
Profundis</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>But the quiet does not last long. Towards five
o’clock a frightful fire begins all at once. The
troops in the front-line trenches, at the bottom
of the hill, are decimated and cut down by a furious
fire; they retreat and take refuge behind the
defense works of the village.</p>

<p>We make our final preparations. Evidently the
enemy is going to try to take the village and has
already begun its destruction. A storm of great
shells falls on the trenches, very near us, some
yards behind the houses. We hear terrific explosions,
the falling of roofs, and fires break out
everywhere.</p>

<p>An order from the commander of the sector
reaches us, “Maintain the position and hold on
until the companies of reinforcements arrive.”</p>

<p>The bombardment becomes more and more
violent. As the sound of each shell whistles
through the air we wonder if this infernal machine
is going to strike in our dugout this time. And
every two minutes, mathematically, the uproar
comes again and this unimaginable suffering continues
some hours. At the sound of each shell we
close our eyes. We think of the loved ones with
a calm certainty of never seeing them again. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
begin to wish that it would end at once, rather
than have to endure this terrible nervous tension
longer.</p>

<p>And the reinforcements cannot advance under
the avalanche of fire and shell. Are they going
to let us be massacred on the spot without defense?</p>

<p>The Teuton artillery imagines that they have
cleared the objective and their fire dies down.
Cautiously but confident of their superiority and
tactics, the Germans now appear in numbers.</p>

<p>Suddenly, violently, like a clap of thunder the
“Marseillaise” bursts on our ears—tremendously.</p>

<p>It rushes out through all the breaches in the
church; it comes through the cracks; it goes up
through the fallen roof; it traverses the shattered
windows. It unites in itself all human and celestial
voices. The soul of a whole nation, the spirit
of ancient glories, animates the old organ which
sings its last song.</p>

<p>With all the strength of its breath, with all the
breath of its pipes, filled to bursting, with all the
sonority of its bass, its horns, its flutes and violins,
the organ hurls forth the sacred song.</p>

<p>And it is not only the hymn of triumphant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
Liberty and the indignation of an avenging people
in the face of the invader. Magnified by the liturgical
sounds on the ritualistic instrument of sacred
music, it is the Hosanna of Glory, the Sursam
Corda of Faith, confident in the approaching victory,
the Resurexit of the triumphant Past, and
the De Profundis of brutal domination.</p>

<p>And beside all that, all the songs of glory, all
the exaltations of faith, all the clamor of Gregorian
theogony vibrate in the notes of the
“Marseillaise.”</p>

<p>Under the humble vault of a hamlet chapel the
organ plays the twice-blessed music, and intones
the splendid Magnificat of the Republic, the hymn
of the Trinity, thrice human, thrice divine, Liberty,
Fraternity and Equality.</p>

<p>And, dominating all the sonorities of the organ,
a thousand voices unite in a sublime burst of song,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“<i>Aux armes, citoyens!</i> ...”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Grenades!” commands the lieutenant.</p>

<p>The men, electrified, mouths half open, the
machines in their hands, spring out of the trench
in the teeth of the enemy, but two steps from him.
And with an irresistible dash they charge him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
follow him, crumble him. The Teutons flee in
terror....</p>

<p class="tb">Night has fallen. Under a sky reddened by
the lights of fires deep silence is over everything.
Numerous reinforcements have arrived. The reconquered
positions have been reorganized at
once.</p>

<p>The general has been told of the exploit and
he congratulates the officers and men, and promises
them rewards. He also expresses a desire to
see the church from which came the martial hymn
which electrified the company.</p>

<p>All is dark....</p>

<p>At the back near the altar a small lantern
lightens the darkness ... we approach.</p>

<p>On the ruined harmonium, forever silent now,
“Father Music” sleeps....</p>

<span class="smaller">“WE HAVE TAKEN A PICKET POST”</span></h2>

<p class="center">(“Communique du”)</p>

<p>The asphyxiating shells which have been
falling around us for forty-eight hours
without a let-up have ceased. This morning the
first rays of the sun filtered through the layers of
gas and seemed to evaporate them. This lull
was opportune. Our masks have long since been
glued to our faces, and loosened by our heavy
breathing they no longer adhere hermetically and
begin to let in the toxins.</p>

<p>At last we are able to breathe at will and
swallow our share of pure air.</p>

<p>Our sap opens on the side of a great quarry and
commands the whole valley of the Somme. At
our feet is the canal and towpath, at the right in
a group of trees in the middle of the marshes are
the ruins of Froissy; opposite us, behind the buttress
of the La Vache woods, is the steeple of
Éclusier.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>The open space in front of our dugout forms
a sort of terrace. Here we have laid out tables
and dug seats in the chalk of the quarry. Men
are descending by real scaling paths to get water
from the canal, although it is against the major’s
explicit orders.</p>

<p>The towpath is visible from the enemy’s
trenches on the other side of the Somme. During
the preceding days, those who tried to follow
it to get back to Éclusier more easily were
wounded by the fire of a machine gun which
sweeps the way.</p>

<p>Our men come back from this expedition without
accident, and we are able to proceed to our
summary ablutions. We have not been able to
do that for six days, and it is a real delight to
feel the fresh water on our eyes and to rid the
skin of its sticky moisture.</p>

<p>Two of our sections hold the first-line trenches
twenty yards in front of us. We must relieve
them presently....</p>

<p>The artillery is still silent, and without a doubt
the enemy has given up the stroke he was preparing.
He was counting on the usual morning mist
of the Somme, but this morning the air is very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
clear without a suspicion of fog. A fresh breeze
blows from the north.</p>

<p>As we wait for the hour of relief, we talk, and
an interminable game of cards goes on.</p>

<p>During the dark dreary days of forced seclusion
in the bottom of the sap I discovered a very
fine fellow, one of our comrades whom I had not
had occasion to notice until then. He was very
simple, talked but little, lived by himself, and I
did not know his name.</p>

<p>Chance placed us side by side and permitted me
to engage him in conversation.</p>

<p>Under a rough, taciturn appearance I found a
soul full of kindness, a life touched by sacrifice,
kindly, modest, the heroism of the humble who
live simply for their long, hard tasks without complaining
and without anyone being able to pity
them in their sorrow and lighten their burdens.</p>

<p>One night—was it night?—hermetically
sealed in the deep sap, lighted only by the wavering
light of scanty candles, all our hours were
nocturnal. Without the irregular arrival of
supply parties we would have been absolutely
ignorant of the flight of time.</p>

<p>One night, when the bombardment seemed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
reach the final height of violence, when each blow
shook our dugout, and the props groaned and
threatened to yield—it would have been a merciless
burial—our looks crossed and I read in his
eyes a deep sorrow.</p>

<p>In spite of my natural reserve, out of respect to
his deep suffering I was unable to contain myself
long.</p>

<p>“Comrade,” I said, “I read in your looks a
great sorrow.”</p>

<p>He seemed to come back to reality when he
heard my voice!</p>

<p>“Fate has placed us near each other for some
days. We don’t know what to-morrow may bring.
Can’t I be of some use? Aid you in any way?
Tell me!”</p>

<p>His eyes tried to smile a thanks. I saw his
lips contract and then came tears, and before I
could say anything he leaned his head on my
shoulder and wept deeply.</p>

<p>It was not weakness, despair, or fear, but the
unbridling of a heart shut up too long, the great
gasp of a soul heavy with mental sorrows which
might at last open itself, the gentle rain which
brought the stifling storm of the nerves to an end.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>He confided his life history to me in a few
words.</p>

<p>He was a simple artisan of the laboring class,
and his life had been full of grief and sorrow.
After some years of struggles, and cares and stress
together with his beloved companion, a daughter
was born. But in coming into the world she took
the life of her mother. And then he found himself
alone in the world with this puny frail creature,
born in grief and raised in sorrow.</p>

<p>In addition to his great love for her as a father
he added his worship of the departed one. He
limited his life to his grief, and made his house
a memorial chapel where every object was a votive
offering to his absent beloved and a relic of the
ever-present dead. He adorned the little girl
with her mother’s modest jewelry, and cut her
clothes from those she had worn.</p>

<p>Through this double love which he poured out
on this child, she became his only reason for existence,
his whole life.</p>

<p>The little girl was ten years old to-day.
Brought up in the seclusion of the tabernacle,
she had taken up her rôle conscientiously. She
was quieter than most children of her age, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
attentive to her father’s slightest wish. As she
grew up she developed into the very image of her
mother, and the poor man began to live again as
in a dream the days of his happy past.</p>

<p>When war broke out the implacable mobilization
tore him from the fireside he had never left
before. Living alone as they did, they had no
friends and knew of no relatives.</p>

<p>He went, trusting the house to her and all their
modest property, only recommending her to the
watch of a neighbor, of a concierge.</p>

<p>But fortified by example, she suddenly grew up
through the grief of this weighty separation, and
the girl was already sufficient for the rôle as
guardian of the hearth.</p>

<p>Ever since he had left she had written each
week the letter which he waited for impatiently
and which he read and re-read during the following
days.</p>

<p class="tb">This morning he seemed more cheerful. It
was not only the joy of finding himself in the open
air again, of having finished with the constant
danger of being buried alive, but also because now
the bombardment had died down the officer with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
the mail would be able to bring to-day the letters
which we had not received for six days.</p>

<p>The child had not failed to write a single time
on the promised date and he knew that back in
the rear a letter from his daughter was waiting
for him and would come to-day. This thought
made him cheerful.</p>

<p class="tb">At the relief I went with him into the front line
trench. It was riddled with shell holes. Our
barbed wire entanglements were almost destroyed,
but the trench was not entirely ruined, and sandbags
quickly put it in good shape again. An immense
heap of bricks and smoking ruins cut off
our view in front.</p>

<p>It was all that was left of a farmhouse called
“La Maison Rose.” It had been sharply disputed
in terrible combats and had passed in succession
from the enemy into our hands and then from
ours to the enemy, to remain finally between the
lines.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">The front line Trench</span> <a href="#Page_154"><i>See page 154</i></a></p>
</div>

<p>Our artillery was riddling this pile with shells
to prevent the Germans fortifying it and making
it a point of support commanding our trenches.
But the mass of ruins stayed there and formed a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
ridge which, if it was not dangerous, was at least
annoying.</p>

<p>Sub-Lieutenant Delpos demonstrated to me by
means of a periscope the use they might make of
that pile of stones. He was a daring but prudent
tactician and went on the principle that everything
ought to be used to spare the men’s lives, and that
we should not neglect to take advantage of any
incident in the terrain.</p>

<p>“Lieutenant, here’s an order.”</p>

<p>The battalion intelligence officer handed him a
paper written in pencil:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Chief of battalion of the company of machine guns.
A reconnaissance of aeroplanes signals that the enemy are
installing gas-throwing or liquid fire machines behind
the pile of stones in front of your lines. Blow it up
with several bombs on the ends to scatter it. Ask for
volunteers.”</p>

</div>

<p>“See what I told you. The Germans lose no
time in utilizing the advantages of the terrain.
See, behind that pile of stones they are installing
their gas machines. They think they’re sheltered,
but nothing is from our aeroplanes. Oh, the
aeroplanes!”</p>

<p>A man from the engineers, who have received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
a similar order, comes with the explosives. He
looks at the emplacement through a loophole, and
turns to us whistling and shaking his head:</p>

<p>“<i>Mince!</i> That’s not going to be easy. One
might be able to manage it at night, but by day
... that’s going to be a real bird trap.”</p>

<p>“What! What! What’s to stop your sticking
your melinite sausage in that doghouse? Lend
me your peephole. I’m going to see how it
stands.”</p>

<p>It was Grizard mixing in the conversation; he
had already taken the two bombs from the engineer’s
hands, which he let go with evident satisfaction.</p>

<p>“We ought to put one in each end of the buffet.
Don’t worry, Lieutenant. That’s a fine job and
will be well done.”</p>

<p>Grizard turns to his companion Marseille who
is draining his two litre canteen without trouble.</p>

<p>“Oh, there, you. This will be a fine chance
for a ballad. We’re going to play a trick on
our neighbor opposite.”</p>

<p>And then, as Marseille gave his opinion only
by a look without letting go the neck of his
canteen:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>“Come, leave some until we get back. We’ll
be thirsty.”</p>

<p>The two volunteers got ready for their expedition
at once. They each took a bomb and put it
in their jacket pockets; protected their heads by
a shield which they pushed ahead, and climbed
up the bank, crawled under the barbed wire, and
disappeared in the shell holes.</p>

<p>They had covered their heads with muddy canvas.
If they remained motionless, three yards
away one could not tell them from the ground.</p>

<p>Through periscopes we watched them advance.
The lookouts in the enemy trench had not seen
them yet. Not a shot. Absolute quiet.</p>

<p>The “doghouse” is thirty yards from our lines.
Sliding along carefully as they must, ten minutes
are necessary to get there. The time will seem
long; longer for us than for them.</p>

<p>I am sure that while they are giving their whole
attention to getting on in their adventurous spirits,
entirely ignorant of the first feeling of fear, that
they have no other idea in their heads than to play
a good joke on the Boches. They are fine jokers!
They have never been known to draw back from
what offers, but when their lives are at stake....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>There is still nothing. Not a shot!</p>

<p>But how could the enemy lookouts see them?
We ourselves who know their goal, who follow
their trail, lose sight of them momentarily. Brown
grass and burned shrubbery covers the ground at
that spot; they must be there inside.</p>

<p>The ten minutes have gone now. Still nothing!!!</p>

<p>Have they seen a danger we cannot see as they
neared the goal, and have they burrowed themselves
in the ground? Nevertheless, their mission
is extremely urgent, and they know it.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Delpos nervously frets about and
stamps his foot,</p>

<p>“I ought to have gone myself....”</p>

<p>“Wait, there they are.”</p>

<p>Marseille and Grizard are coming back; they
are only ten feet from the trench.</p>

<p>But rash to madness, in their absolute unconsciousness
of danger now that their mission is accomplished,
they take no thought of themselves,
and instead of sliding under the barbed wire, as
they went, to get into the dugout Grizard stands
up and shouts,</p>

<p>“Let the balloon go up.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>At the same moment, a shower of bullets!</p>

<p>Grizard rebounded, twisted himself in a
final contortion, and fell on his back while Marseille
jumped into the trench shouting to his
comrade,</p>

<p>“Haven’t you finished playing the man-serpent?”</p>

<p>Then, when he saw that his comrade was absolutely
dead, he burst out in wild anger:</p>

<p>“Nom de Dieu ... Nom de Dieu ... de
nom de Dieu.... If that isn’t too bad....
He needn’t stay there, the rascal. I’m going to
get him.”</p>

<p>The explosion came, a frightful one; the bombs
had just exploded.</p>

<p>“To the sap ... to the sap. It’s going to
rain stones.”</p>

<p>The pile of stones is thrown up with tremendous
violence. Blocks are thrown into the trench.</p>

<p>The smoke blows away and behind the scattered
ruins we see two machine guns in position
with their gun crews killed beside them, and all
their material for fortifications and gas-making
apparatus.</p>

<p>The sub-lieutenant jumps on the parapet,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>“To the bayonet, forward, enfants, get the
tools.”</p>

<p>And before the enemy had recovered from his
stupefaction, our men are on the guns, which they
get and bring back in a hurry under a storm of
bullets and grenades.</p>

<p>When we are back from this sudden attack, we
call the roll. Several fail to answer, and among
them my friend of the day before.</p>

<p>I suffer as though he had been my own brother.</p>

<p>That night, when the storm of fire has ceased,
we try to search carefully through the darkness
of the terrain where our missing men have fallen.
Groans tells us that they are there, but in their
fever and pain no one answers our calls.</p>

<p>At daybreak, at the risk of the bullets which
still whistle above the trench, we are able to see
them.</p>

<p>There he was scarcely twenty yards away, his
large eyes open and looking towards us ... beyond
us ... very far. But I know where!!!</p>

<p>The day begins quietly. Doubtless the enemy
is meditating a revenge for yesterday’s surprise;
not a shot on our side or on the other. It is the
silence after the storm. I begin to hope for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
sudden attack which will let us go out and bring
back our wounded.</p>

<p>A man brings the letters with our morning
coffee. There was one for him and I call and
tell him. He answers with a sigh. I guess rather
than hear what he wants.</p>

<p>“Read me the letter, very loud so I can hear
it.” And in a voice which I force myself to make
firm and almost joyous, while sobs choke me, I
read this letter:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“My darling Papa:</p>

<p>“You did not expect a letter from me to-day for it’s
not my usual day. I wanted to surprise you. To-morrow
is mamma’s birthday. With the economies I made out
of the allowance, I had my picture taken. I put on for
the occasion her beautiful necklace and pretty red silk
blouse which is so becoming to me. The neighbors already
see how much I look like her.</p>

<p>“And that my little souvenir might be still more
precious, I have copied on the back of the picture the song
which you taught me when I was very small so that I
could sing it before mamma’s portrait.</p>

<p>“This song, now that you are no longer here, tells all
that my heart would say to you on this day I long for you,
mamma’s birthday. It has become my evening prayer.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“‘<i>Oh! si tu savais, loin de foi,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Combien les heures sont amères,</i></div>

</div>
</div>

</div>

<p>Then, before I finished my reading, his voice
continued the song of the child as he lay there on
the point of death. In the hour of death his grave
voice had a celestial accent; the simple song went
up like a superhuman song, a seraphic song, above
men, beyond all things. It penetrated to the
bottom of our souls and probed our hearts and
brought tears.</p>

<p>The barbarians on the other side of the trench,
themselves fathers, husbands, brothers, understand
that a father is dying calling to his child;
that a past common to us all lives again in that
last agony. And their arms rest inert, their guns
are lowered, and all the fierce warriors remain
motionless, dreaming, lost in the contemplation
of their inner dreams. Alone, their hearts beat
and bleed.</p>

<p class="tb">Suddenly someone shouts an oath from the
German trench. A brute blasphemes,</p>

<p>“<i>Halt dein Maul</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>A shot sounds. A bullet puts an end to that
beatific agony.</p>

<p>Then, there was no need of a signal or an
order. Tears dried spontaneously; rage bit our
lips and lighted our eyes.</p>

<p>With a bound, with a single bound, sudden,
violent, unanimous, we jumped the parapet, and
without the enemy’s firing a shot in his utter surprise,
we bounded into the German trench. Five
minutes later, there was none left alive.</p>

<p>Bowing my head over the body of my friend,
I placed the picture of his child on his still moist
lips.</p>

<p class="tb">The Communique will say:</p>

<p>“South of the Somme we took a picket post
by surprise, captured two machine guns and considerable
material for making asphyxiating gas.
Our losses are insignificant.”</p>

<p class="tb">And the public will think that very simple—a
picket post ... two machine guns ... and
no losses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII<br />
<span class="smaller">A NIGHT CONVOY</span></h2>

<p>The colonel just telephoned the following
order:</p>

<p>“The echelons of the companies of machine
guns will bring, to-night, thirty thousand cartridges
to the P. C.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> of the regiment. This order
must be executed before daylight.”</p>

<p>We spent the afternoon in verifying the belts
and making up the war train.</p>

<p>Towards seven o’clock we went slowly towards
the bridge at Froissy, where we made a long halt
until night fell. The sentry refused to let us take
the towpath which would save us some eight miles.</p>

<p>These were his instructions!</p>

<p>It appears that the noises of the caissons and
wagons might wake up the enemy, who would
at once bombard the towpath near which were
numerous huts of regiments who were resting.</p>

<p>So we crossed the canal, and in order to get to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
Cappy on our right, we have to go round by
Bray-sur-Somme.</p>

<p>But this road has its distractions.</p>

<p>The road is absolutely torn up and it is not five
yards wide anywhere, in fact it is an infernal
mixture of automobiles, artillery, caissons and
batteries.</p>

<p>No one will slow up. They cross over, go
around, hang on, shout, bellow, insult, and get
past as best they can. Our mules are obstinate
and stubborn and go on their way placidly in the
midst of this uproar.</p>

<p>Once we lean so far to the right that the hubs
of the wheels on the lower side stick in the mud.</p>

<p>We doubtless go ahead slowly, but we go ahead
all the same. The drivers have to go in front of
their beasts. It would be madness for them to
stay on the seats of the ammunition wagons, and
the certain ruin for man and beast, for exhausted
by fatigue, they would fall asleep and get in the
way of the enormous meteors which rush by without
seeing anything.</p>

<p>As we approach Bray, the crowding is beyond
anything one could imagine.</p>

<p>It is one compact mass of wagons, trucks, caissons,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
guns, forage wagons, all entangled, mixed
up, wedged together, trying to get through a
street scarcely wide enough to let two wagons by
and where ten insist on going together.</p>

<p>If we mix with this crowd, we will condemn
ourselves to several hours in one place without
moving. Once in the crush it is impossible to get
free and go back.</p>

<p>Roudon suggests that we twist around the village.
Our wagons have the advantage of being
able to go anywhere. They were made expressly
for this work and have wide wheels and no frames.</p>

<p>We make a passage through a hawthorn hedge
with a few blows of the axe and cross the fields in
spite of the invectives of the gendarmes who persist
in trying to make us circle round in regular
order, just as though we were going around the
Obelisk in the Place de la Concorde.</p>

<p>“Here, brave gendarmes, they pass as they
can. Guns thunder. Shells are near, and it is
necessary to arrive at the appointed time.”</p>

<p>“Instructions thought out by some officer in
the peace and quiet of a faraway office are all rot.
Go on, you’ll find out.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;" id="illus6">
<img src="images/illus6.jpg" width="700" height="430" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">A Commandant’s Post</span> <a href="#Page_165"><i>See page 165</i></a></p>
</div>

<p>We are beyond the village an hour later and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
are on the highway which leads to the bridge at
Cappy.</p>

<p>Here, things are askew again. We must cross
to get over the bridge. We can’t go around that.
So we get into the string of wagons and follow
their pace. They advance in skips and jumps
... they go ahead ten yards, stop a quarter of
an hour, and begin again. One would think he
was in the line at the Opéra on the day of a free
performance.</p>

<p>We stand about in one spot more than three
hours.</p>

<p>Finally, about midnight we reach the entrance
to the bridge.</p>

<p>A new delay!</p>

<p>We have to get out of the way to let convoys
past which are going in the opposite direction.
They are ammunition trucks which make a noise
like thunder.</p>

<p>Just then, some artillerymen, who do not want to
wait and who glory in the not altogether fortunate
reputation of always getting by, no matter what’s
in the way, dash on to the bridge at a gallop.</p>

<p>“That’s it. Now we’re in a pickle, a mess
... that’s the....”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>The poles run into the carburetors, the horses
rear and kick against the hoods with their maddened
hoofs; the motors continue to run, raging
at their impotence.</p>

<p>Nevertheless a way must be cleared through the
bridge. And in the pitch dark night that’s not easy.</p>

<p>A chauffeur has the ingenious idea of lighting a
headlight.</p>

<p>Immediately, evidently judging that this light
is without a doubt insufficient and its aid is indispensable
for us, the German artillery sends us all
the material necessary for clearing the bridge.</p>

<p>It sends us shells and with absolutely no care
at all.</p>

<p>To the right, to the left, in front, and behind,
the shots fall like a hailstorm.</p>

<p>Cries, groans, oaths, and commands impossible
to execute! It is Hell.</p>

<p>In an excess of generosity, doubtless to aid us
in getting out of our difficulty, a well-aimed shell
falls on a truck, sets fire to the gasoline tank, and
the whole thing saturated with paint and covered
with impervious canvas bursts into flames.</p>

<p>We can see. We can see only too well now,
and the Boches too.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>Through their glasses they can easily estimate
what their objective is worth and see what a large
crowd is crowding around the spectacle. And
their bombardment doubles in intensity.</p>

<p>“This is no time to stay here.”</p>

<p>On the trot we gain the fields and follow the
bank lined by poplars.</p>

<p>We reach the limit of the zone of fire in about
three hundred yards. We crowd behind the trees
and hedges to avoid the splinters which can still
reach us.</p>

<p>Suddenly, there is a terrible cry, a noise of something
falling. The bridge has fallen down.</p>

<p>That is fatal.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to be at the P. C. at daybreak, but
I don’t see how we are going to make it.”</p>

<p>There is absolutely nothing to do just now; it
would be folly to try anything, no matter what
it was.</p>

<p>No matter what the cost these convoys must
reach the left bank, where numerous units wait
for the ammunition which they need badly, so the
order is given to silence the enemy’s batteries
which are bombarding us so thoroughly.</p>

<p>All the guns in the valley of Froissy, including<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
the big English guns, thunder out at once in an
astounding uproar....</p>

<p>The enemy returns the fire with a storm of
shrapnel. But the trees with their thick leaves
fortunately protect us from this. We hear splinters
and bullets falling into the waters of the canal
a few yards away.</p>

<p>The fire near the bridge continues. The flames
have reached other vehicles now and a great cloud
goes up in the air lighting up the surrounding
country. No one even dares to think of trying
to put it out in the thick rain of bullet and shell.</p>

<p>Roudon is disturbed. He is a man of duty, to
whom an order is a sacred thing. No obstacle
should prevent the execution of an order, so he
proposes that we go back to Froissy and reach
the P. C. of the regiment by way of the Cappy
plateau.</p>

<p>“That’s mad, <i>mon vieux</i>. We’d never make
it before nine o’clock in the morning, and we’d all
be killed going that way in the open.”</p>

<p>“So much the worse. It is necessary to bring
the ammunition. It is an order and it is urgent.”</p>

<p>“Wait a little while until this quiets down.
They’ll not go on like this all night.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, they will too; they’ve seen the convoys
and they’ll keep up the barrage until daylight.”</p>

<p>“If we could only find a boat. We could take
the caissons to the other side. The quarry isn’t
far from there. The men could carry them.”</p>

<p>“What are you thinking about? Going to find
a boat at this time of night! And with what is
falling into the canal we’d run some risk in
crossing....”</p>

<p class="tb">Far from silencing the enemy, the fire of our
batteries exasperates him.</p>

<p>Heavy guns, guns on tractors doubtless, have
been brought into play. “280’s” and “210’s”
come at regular intervals.</p>

<p>The Boches must have thought they had surprised
a strategic movement much more important
than it really was and were trying to check it.</p>

<p>The place is becoming untenable.</p>

<p>At the edge of the canal is a large stable for the
canal horses, and a crowd of drivers, gunners, and
cyclists have taken refuge there. It falls apart
when a great shell strikes it. A terrible cry goes
up and the building bursts into flames all over,
like tow soaked in oil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>No one knows how many bodies are burned to
cinders there. A frightful odor assails our nostrils
in the smoke which encircles us.</p>

<p>A heavy rolling roar, boring through the night
like the noise of an express train coming out of
a tunnel at high speed, comes from over there,
from the black hole where the enemy is.</p>

<p>“That’s a terrific fire!”</p>

<p>“Look out.”</p>

<p>A violent puff, like a heavy blow, knocks us
down.</p>

<p>The mules rear and draw back. A wagon slides
down the bank and falls into the water, taking its
animal and driver with it.</p>

<p>A shell has burst on the bank opposite and it
has torn up by the roots a large poplar which falls
across the canal. It is a miracle that it didn’t
crush a dozen of us. We run to help the driver.
The water is shallow. He holds himself up by
the weeds. We pull him out with the aid of several
lengths of whip lash, but the mule and the
wagon have rolled into the middle of the canal
and are lost.</p>

<p>The bombardment continues until dawn, but less
violently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>A few shots, the longest, come near us. The
pounding continues on the site of the bridge, obstinately
and stubbornly.</p>

<p>We are still there at the first rays of dawn.</p>

<p>“This is exasperating. We can never get these
munitions to the P. C. before daylight.”</p>

<p>“Say, Roudon, we have a bridge right in front
of us. It will do.”</p>

<p>And indeed the large poplar might let us get
across the canal.</p>

<p>We try it.</p>

<p>We leave one man to guard the five wagons,
and the rest detach the caissons from their supports,
hang them on our shoulders, and one after
another we try the chance bridge which bends a
little but does not break.</p>

<p>Less than fifteen minutes later all the munitions
are together on the opposite bank.</p>

<p>We reached the P. C. at five o’clock, exhausted
without a doubt, but the order has been
executed.</p>

<p class="tb">When the artillery officer saw us arriving, he
started shouting,</p>

<p>“What do you want me to do with that?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>Roudon repeated the order he had received the
day before.</p>

<p>“So you haven’t received the cancellation of
the order? You always ought to wait for that.
We were relieved last night. Take that stuff back
where you got it from.”</p>

<p>We carried the caissons back to our wagons by
the same way, by the same bridge.</p>

<p>Captain D ... was coming along the towpath
and saw us arrive.</p>

<p>Roudon was furious as he told him about our
useless adventure which might have cost us so
dear.</p>

<p>He listened, laughed, then, coldly:</p>

<p>“Bah! that will do the mules good. They’ll
get used to marching at night....”</p>

<p>Fontaine-les-Cappy is some hundred
yards from the lines.</p>

<p>It is a reserve position to which the company
was sent the day before in expectation of an attack
which may come at any moment.</p>

<p>It is raining as it hasn’t stopped raining for
weeks. We had floundered in the mud for five
hours and were splashed by an endless string of
convoys to get here from Villers where the regiment
had scarcely begun a few short days of rest.</p>

<p>The men were tired out and threw themselves
on the filthy straw. They have slept nearly all
day, and this evening in groups they try their
hardest to organize a respectable meal from the
means at their disposal. The wine flows from full
canteens, and flasks of cheap brandy come out of
the packs.</p>

<p>The section leaders advise them to save some
of their provisions for the next day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>“To-morrow! What do you think? To-morrow
we’ll lunch with the Boches. You! I’ll
pay you in sauerkraut.”</p>

<p>Conversation gradually grew less amid the falling
darkness and the smoke of pipes.</p>

<p>The silence became profound.</p>

<p>The men are not sleeping. They think and remember.
Sadness and worry hover about....</p>

<p>Far away, hesitating, a voice sings a prelude.
But that voice is so pure and clear that it seems
enormous, startling, vibrating in the dull numbness
of men and things.</p>

<p>Vigne is humming a song of Provence, a hymn
to the sun, which from the banks of the Durance
to the shores of the Latin sea, from the blue hills
of the Alps to the golden flowers of Vacarès, the
youths and maidens of Avignon, Arles, and Maillamne
sing as they return to the hospitable farm
from their labors, their hands entwined for the
farandole, with eyes full of smiles and love for
the bright sun which makes them live and love.</p>

<p>Vigne was sitting in a corner, elbows on his
knees, chin between his hands, his face lifted, and
singing unconsciously, his eyes on the distance.</p>

<p>A candle stuck in the neck of a bottle throws a
flickering light on the damp ground of the cellar,
and scarcely separates his outlines from the
darkness.</p>

<p>Gradually one follows in, one after another,
naturally, and they all begin to sing.</p>

<p>And music and rhythm form so large a part of
their natures that they form a wonderful choir
where the thirds and minors take form instinctively
without an effort, and where the dream of
their homeland marks the time.</p>

<p>And they sing from their souls, and through it
all is the sun of their beautiful South, the poetry
of their dawns, the charm of their twilights, the
mystic gleams of the olives, the flight of the red
flamingoes on the pools, the coming down of the
shepherds from the perfumed hills, the mad career
of the bulls in clouds of dust on the white roads
of Camargue, the gold of the mimosas, the red of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
the wild poppies, the blue sky, the blue sea, the

<p>These soft voices, monotonous, hesitating a
moment ago, which seemed scarcely awake, now
sound out, vibrant, dashing, sonorous.</p>

<p>They are no longer uprooted exiles who are
stirred; it is a force, a crowd, a people whom the
song of their birthplace awakes, draws together,
cheers. It is Provence herself that sings.</p>

<p>Outside, the cannon roar and the shells fall like
hail around the cantonment. Great shells tear
up the ground with their gigantic blows.</p>

<p>War, horrors, blood, ruins, fear, the attack
which is near at hand, death perhaps, all that
exists no longer for them. It is all of no consequence
to them; the air of their natal song transports
them.</p>

<p>These men shut up in dark cellars, in dugouts,
shaken by the terrific hammering of shells, are
transported by their dream to the bright sunshine,
the bright and cheerful atmosphere of their southern
plains. They sing, and at once they are living
again the life of their homeland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>Their “little” country dominates them and
makes them valiant and strong in the midst of the
sorrows all about to attack and stand up in defense

<p>I go out with my nerves on edge and my eyes
full of tears before the unearthly beauty of the
scene.</p>

<p>Streaks of light from the stuffed air-holes alone
let me realize that men in large numbers wait
there underground for a signal to dash into the
fiery furnace....</p>

<p>I walk to the end of the village to the officers’
quarters to calm my nerves.</p>

<p>Voices still rise in song on both sides of the
road. There, under my feet in a ruin—so martyred
that one might think it was an acropolis
raising prayers of stone to heaven—a chorus of
warm voices scans the joyous song,</p>

<p>Here are the lads of Languedoc, Nîmes, Montpellier,
the vine growers of the plains, the carters
of Aiguesmortes, the harvesters of Toulouse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
all carried away by the evocation of their
homeland.</p>

<p>Oh! the beautiful song! How it puts heart
into one; more beautiful than the most martial
hymn composed in the harsh technique of the ink
pots.</p>

<p>It is the living expression, simple, spontaneous,
natural, of the people, the family and the soil. It
carries in it the remembrances of happy childhood,
of loves bathed in sunshine, the radiant nuptials
in the mystery of light and flowers. It speaks of
the loved pastures, the paternal roof, the farm,
the herds, the vines ... and that is the
Patrie.</p>

<p>Oh! the beautiful song! It dissipates dark
thoughts, fears, uncertainties; it makes lovers
and heroes, electrifies them, and increases their
strength a hundred fold. They are the lads of
Provence and Languedoc who spread through the
world the triumphal “Marseillaise.” They are
the same lads who despite the mud and the dark
night breathe in their memory and in the song the
re-vivifying breath of their “little” country, who
in pursuit of the routed enemy make the “Marseillaise”
victorious again, victorious alway.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>At the end of the village in a house at the side
of the road to Chuignolles, a feeble light filters
through the canvas which takes the place of
shutters.</p>

<p>The officers are quartered here. Lieutenant
Casanova is stretched out on a mattress on
the ground, smoking and dreaming over his
eternal cigarette. Lieutenant Delpos leaning
on a box which serves him for a table, is reading,
by the light of a lantern, an illustrated
novel.</p>

<p>I look over his shoulder. They are rather
sprightly, suggestive illustrations, reinforced with
a vengeance by the fervid imagination and second-hand
talent of the readers who have handed it
around.</p>

<p>The wind and rain rage outside the window.
Poor weather for an attack.</p>

<p>“I’m sure that we’ve come here for nothing.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that can be launched at any time.”</p>

<p>“I should be much surprised if it came this
evening.”</p>

<p>“Listen.”</p>

<p>A heavy, faraway, continuous rumble, like the
beating of a drum, is heard just then.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>The sound seems to come from the direction of
Lihons and to get nearer by degrees.</p>

<p>In the midst of the fusillade we hear distinctly
the regular crackle of the machine guns.</p>

<p>Suddenly, a terrific fire breaks out opposite us.
D ... company, which we are to support, must
have gone into action.</p>

<p>“That’s getting close.”</p>

<p>We go out. The road forms a sort of embankment
at this spot, which is forbidden during the
daytime, and from which we look toward the
lines.</p>

<p>A great light has risen. More and more frequent
bursts of shrapnel at this distance have the
effect of immense red Venetian lanterns, tossed
about by the wind in the dark night.</p>

<p>Rockets go up suddenly on our right.</p>

<p>That is a call for the artillery. The expected
attack is probably taking place over there. We
have been placed in reserve for fear that the attack
might widen out on the sector, but it is probable
that we shall not have to intervene.</p>

<p>“It looks as though it were quieting down
there in front.”</p>

<p>“Hum! You’ll see.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>Lieutenant Casanova has had great experience
in battles, and he isn’t taken by surprise by apparent
lulls. On the contrary. Silence is what he
dreads most.</p>

<p>“You’ll see.”</p>

<p>And as a matter of fact we didn’t have long to
wait.... A tornado of shells falls between the
lines and our cantonment. This is immediately
followed by another, then still another, all in a
couple of minutes.</p>

<p>It is a barrage of “77’s,” effected by a battery
which has taken us in its fire.</p>

<p>“I certainly think that something is going to
happen.”</p>

<p>“Go and tell the section leaders to get their
men together and to have them ready.”</p>

<p>I go into the night in search of the cantonment.</p>

<p>All the men are awake. The corporals and
sergeants have foreseen the order and everyone is
waiting.</p>

<p>The shells and the fire of our rifles and our
machine guns is only one frightful uproar in which
all noises are confounded.</p>

<p>As I return toward the officers badly aimed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
spent machine-gun bullets whistle in the trees
above.</p>

<p>“All we can do is to wait. If they need us,
they’ll call us.”</p>

<p>As he said this the ever-imperturbable Lieutenant
Casanova went back into his quarters and we
followed him.</p>

<p>“I suggest poker,” said Delpos. “I’ll go and
find the cards.”</p>

<p>“Three-handed poker is too risky.”</p>

<p>“Well, here’s a fourth.”</p>

<p>Someone raised the canvas which served as a
door.</p>

<p>It’s an intelligence officer from the colonel.</p>

<p>“Lieutenant, D ... company is running out
of munitions. Pass yours to them and send back
for new supplies. Here’s the order.”</p>

<p>The lieutenant read the order and said:</p>

<p>“All right. It will be done.”</p>

<p>Hardly twenty minutes later, ten men from
each section, each carrying four caissons, were
assembled on the way out of the village.</p>

<p>D ... company’s position, which we marked
yesterday, is about six hundred yards away and
some yards beyond the ridge of the plateau between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
the main road from Amiens and the Somme.
There’s little chance of losing the way, for it is
downhill. We might pass through the fields but
thirty yards before reaching the trench the ground
is literally swept with shells. It is impossible to
use the communication trench. The enemy artillery
has located it mathematically and has completely
destroyed it. The shells fall there without
a let-up. The least dangerous passage is the
unprotected ground.</p>

<p>Stretched out in the mud, the head of one
against the heels of the other, our men form an
endless chain on the terrain which extends from
the sheltered ridge to the fire trench. They pass
along the caissons by a simple movement of the
arms, without raising their bodies or their heads.</p>

<p>In the same way and by the same means, crawling
along, I reach the trenches in my turn and
fall in.</p>

<p>Captain D ... is there, striding from one gun
to another, encouraging his men and hurrying
their fire.</p>

<p>“I was sure that I was going to run out of ammunition.
They were already within one hundred
and fifty yards.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>“We’ve passed you one hundred and sixty
caissons. We’ve sent men for more and they’ll
be here in half an hour.”</p>

<p>“We don’t need any more. It’s all over.
Their attempt is broken. By daylight we’ll see
more than two hundred bodies in front of our
barbed wire. You can go. I thank you. Take
my regards and thanks to Lieutenant Casanova.”</p>

<p>The firing continued all night, sometimes intermittently,
sometimes in violent salvos, so that one
might imagine that the enemy was making another
attack.</p>

<p>At dawn we only heard rare, isolated detonations.</p>

<p class="tb">Our men returned to the cantonment uninjured.
There were a few scratches and slight wounds in
the hands, but there was no discharge in sight.</p>

<p>Some of them had had narrow escapes. Bullets
had ricochetted and gone through the steel helmets.
Linari’s was perforated with a round, well-defined
hole. The bullet had gone out close to
the ear.</p>

<p>They were exhausted by lack of sleep, and after
eating a meal hastily thrown together from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
things at hand, they started for their underground
shelters.</p>

<p>Just then the sun rose shining brightly.</p>

<p>In the sky, washed by weeks of rain, it was so
clear and smiling with warmth that one would
have thought it was a sunrise in the South.</p>

<p>“Say, this morning that’s the sun of the
South!”</p>

<p>“What’s it doing here? It’s made a mistake.”</p>

<p>“Beautiful sun! Indeed, there’s only you.”</p>

<p>And in the pure morning air, these peasants of
Provence saluted the rising sun by shouting the
joyous song which, a few hours before, had
brightened their night.</p>

<p>The attack was heavy; it is over. They have
come back from it. They are still alive. We must
begin all over again, to-night, perhaps; possibly
this evening; perhaps in an hour. Death lurks
everywhere. What difference does it make?
This morning the sun rose radiantly. They sing!</p>

<span class="smaller">A WATER PATROL</span></h2>

<p>For several days the Germans had been at
work making changes opposite our salient
on the banks of the Somme. Probably it was a
machine-gun emplacement to prevent any attempt
at attack from that side. But as there must be
no obstacle in the way of our next advance, the
major, after talking with the colonel, sent for
Lieutenant Delpos, who was in charge of the
section in that sector and asked him what he
thought of the work.</p>

<p>“It’s hard to say,” he answered. “If they’ve
brought two or three machine guns it will be
humanly impossible even to try to advance. It
all depends on the importance of the work. We
can’t tell from here what it is.”</p>

<p>“Our aeroplane observations and photographs
don’t tell us anything,” said the major. “The
view is partly cut off by the tops of the trees along
the river.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>“Aeroplane observations aren’t everything,”
answered Delpos.</p>

<p>“But I can’t send a patrol over such unprotected
ground. It would be utterly wiped out
before it discovered anything.”</p>

<p>“Will you give me an order,” asked Delpos,
“to make a reconnaissance in whatever way I
think best? In twenty-four hours, at the latest,
I think I can bring you the exact details.”</p>

<p>“Go ahead. Do your best. I’ll send you a
written order to cover it.”</p>

<p>When he got back to his post, Lieutenant Delpos
examined the strip of terrain as thoroughly as
he could by peering over the top of the parapet,
and then asked for the photographs the aeroplanes
had taken. Finally, he studied the map
of the country which the enemy occupied opposite
us. Then, he went to Éclusier, borrowed a boat,
and stayed out in the current calculating its direction
by bunches of grass pulled from the banks.</p>

<p>He came back to the company towards noon
and sent me to the echelon for Gondran, whom
I brought back about three o’clock. At seven
Delpos had his plans made. He went to the
major, who received him at once, and explained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
the project he wanted to put into execution that
evening.</p>

<p>Delpos asked him, as it would probably be
useful in distracting attention, to have the sections
at the extreme north of the sector fire several
heavy volleys between eleven o’clock and midnight.</p>

<p>When this was arranged, everything was ready
for his departure and he invited me to dinner as
he ordinarily did. His dinners were always good
and there was excellent wine which his servant
had managed to find in the ruins of Harbonnière
and Villers.</p>

<p>As he was lighting his cigar after the dessert,
he said:</p>

<p>“We’re going to pay a call on the Boches this
evening. The chances of staying there are about
even, but, in any case, even if we remain, the performance
won’t be uninteresting. It will be as
good as a first night at the ‘Grand-Guignol!’
Take your revolver, some grenades and come
along.”</p>

<p>I would have been highly unappreciative to
have refused such a kind invitation, although adventure,
to say nothing of such a mad adventure,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
has never been to my taste. But Lieutenant Delpos
had the reputation of always getting out, so
why shouldn’t he get out this time.</p>

<p>Gondran was waiting for us a little ways from
Éclusier, in a small creek, hidden under the trees.</p>

<p>Gondran and his boat!</p>

<p>It was one of those flat-bottomed, square-ended
boats that fishermen use to cross marshes where
the water is shallow. He had covered it with a
camouflage of grass, weeds, and moss so that even
close to it was impossible to tell it from one of the
thousand little islands which obstruct the Somme
at this point.</p>

<p>We slipped into the boat and stretched out at
once—it wouldn’t have held us in any other
way—and waited for total darkness. When it
came, Gondran began to push the boat ahead.
He was used to fishing for eels with a spear in the
clear waters of the canals and knew how to move
silently, without a splash, almost without making
a ripple on the surface of the water. If our
course had not been against the current, we might
have been mistaken for a pile of drifting grass.</p>

<p>Flat on his stomach in the stern with both arms
in the water up to his elbows and a stick of wood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
in each hand, slowly and silently he paddled like
a duck.</p>

<p>The officer and I were both flat also, in the bow,
and we peered into the darkness. I held a string
in one hand, and the other end was tied around
Gondran’s arm. We had arranged that one pull
meant to stop and stay where we were; two to go
back.</p>

<p>We went on without accident for nearly two
hours. Suddenly, a bump, a hard jolt, fortunately
without any noise besides the rustling of the
weeds. The night was so thick that it was impossible
to tell what the obstacle was, whether it
was the bank or an island. We tried in vain to
see through the fathomless darkness. We ventured
to feel about with our hands, and, in the
middle of the weeds and reeds, I was gripped by
something. I pulled back my arm, in a hurry, to
get away. A sharp point cut the skin, then another,
and I felt a scratch from my elbow to my
fist.</p>

<p>I whispered in Delpos’s ear, “Barbed wire.”</p>

<p>A network of barbed wire barred the river
here. The Germans had foreseen the possibilities
of an approach and had taken precautions to prevent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
it. Was the network large, or was there
only a single barrier, that was the question. Or,
should we go back? In any case there was no use
in re-appearing before we were expected, for we
had reached their lines.</p>

<p>Since the work under suspicion was a little in
advance of their first trench, we must be nearly
even with it. We had brought wire cutters, but
what was the use of cutting the first net, if we
were to find another beyond it, and then another,
and so on for fifty or a hundred yards perhaps.</p>

<p>The enemy is meticulous in his defenses and
spares no means of protecting himself. It was
also a question whether we were in the middle
of the river or near the bank. By shoving his
paddle down at arm’s length Gondran touched
bottom. So we were going to reach the bank, but
first we must prepare for our retreat. Using the
barbed wire as a guide, we put the boat out into the
middle of the river, but not in the strength of the
current, and then on a stick we had brought along
set up a dummy dressed in the uniform of one of
the Colonials. Then we went back to the bank.</p>

<p>Here was the most ticklish and dangerous moment
of our mission. What, we asked ourselves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
was the shape of the bank and would we find a
sentinel? We brought the boat as near the shore
as possible and in as far as we could. By feeling
to the right we could touch solid ground. The
time had come!... We glided from the boat
like snakes and once on land remained motionless,
holding our breaths. It was impossible to see
anything a yard off; there was no noise except the
far-off rumbling of the guns in the English sector.
We went ahead.... The heavy socks we had
drawn over our boots deadened our steps. The
damp grass bent but did not crackle.</p>

<p>“Conrad! Come here. It is time.”</p>

<p>“What time?”</p>

<p>“Nearly midnight.”</p>

<p>“Good.”</p>

<p>“The lieutenant isn’t here.”</p>

<p>“No?”</p>

<p>“He is with the major and will come back.”</p>

<p>“Come along.”</p>

<p>“But there’s no one here.”</p>

<p>“What of it? Come along.”</p>

<p>This conversation in German stopped us short.
The voices seemed to come from the ground two
steps in front of us. Doubtless there was a sap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
there.... We heard steps getting farther away.
I grabbed the officer and making a megaphone of
my hands whispered in his ear what I had just
understood from their conversation. In the same
way, he responded:</p>

<p>“Inviting you was an inspiration. Since
they’ve gone, we can get in there.”</p>

<p>A few steps beyond in the open ground a feeble
light filtered through sacks hung as shutters. It
was the sap!... We stretched out on the
ground and tried to see inside. There was no one
standing, but if anyone was left he must be asleep,
and we could surprise him.... We jumped in.
Not a soul. Without a doubt it was a post momentarily
empty during a relief. On some overturned
chairs there was a platter with a candle on
it and we put it out. We examined the place with
our flashlight. A communication trench opened
into the post and we started down.</p>

<p>No matter where it led or whether we could
retrace our steps or not, the die was cast. The
number of chances of our getting back alive which
Delpos had said were even seemed to me to have
grown beautifully less. The trench stopped short
within ten yards. Ahead, to the right, to the left,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
we stuck our noses into the solid wall. But the
men had got out someway....</p>

<p>Delpos risked another flash of his light—the
way out was over our heads. It was a shaft
with a ladder leading up it. We heard someone
talking above. The relief was coming
down....</p>

<p>Just then the noise of firing came from our own
lines. The sections were firing as had been arranged.
This wise precaution served beyond our
utmost expectations, for above us began at once
the rapid tac-tac of the machine guns and we
heard commands.</p>

<p>So the shaft led into the machine-gun emplacement.
That was just what we wanted to know;
our reconnaissance was at an end.</p>

<p>Delpos drove a cheddite bomb into the wall
beneath the ladder, and I tied a slow fuse to it.
We jumped towards the river. I lighted the
fuse as I jumped from the sap, just as an immense
body appeared in the opening and blocked the
way.</p>

<p>“<i>Wer da?</i>”</p>

<p>“‘<i>Wer da?</i>’ you’ll find out who is there,”
Delpos muttered, and with a blow full on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
chest, while I threw myself on his legs, we got
the colossus down, as he shouted for help.</p>

<p>But the firing drowned his cries.</p>

<p>Then, to deprive him of all interest in keeping
on, I applied my revolver to his forehead,
and Delpos kicked him under the chin. We left
him senseless and voiceless for at least a quarter
of an hour.</p>

<p>We jumped into our boat and slid under the
camouflage. Whether we had made too much
noise or a sentinel had heard us, I don’t know,
but we were hardly there, and were just pushing
off, when shots came in our direction, star shells
lighted the river, and men ran up and down the
bank.</p>

<p>We heard them cry, “There he is ...
there....” They had seen our dummy in the
middle of the river and were firing at him with
rifles and bombarding him with grenades. We
did not move. By stretching out an arm we could
almost have touched the legs of the men who came
down to the water’s edge to hurl their grenades.
None of them dreamed we were so near.</p>

<p>The alarm lasted about twenty seconds; it
seemed like a century.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>We knew that the blockhouse was going to
blow up and we wanted to be far away for the
débris were likely to reach us and crush us.</p>

<p>Suddenly, terribly, came the explosion.</p>

<p>It was fortunate for us that the alarm had
held us close to the bank. Whole blocks of
granite were hurled into the middle of the river
just where we would have been. We were too
near and too low and everything went over us.</p>

<p>The violence of the waves tore us from the
bank and drove us into the strength of the current,
and we weren’t fired on once. The whole
garrison had been blown up.</p>

<p class="tb">At daybreak, three o’clock in the morning,
Lieutenant Delpos woke up the major.</p>

<p>“Major,” he said, “it was a machine-gun emplacement.
But it is no more. If you will allow
me, I’m going to bed. I couldn’t get any sleep
over there; there was too much noise.”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI<br />
<span class="smaller">A COMMANDER</span></h2>

<p>At the beginning of June, the colonel’s report
informed us that the major of Battalion
C ... had been assigned to the ... first
Colonials.</p>

<p>The battalion commandant’s post was next to
ours on the ridge of the quarry.</p>

<p>Since the departure of Major L ... the captain
adjutant-major, who was assuming the command
in the interim, was quartered there. He
was devoting himself to his ablutions in the open
place in front of his dugout and at the same time
telling Lieutenants C ... and D ..., his
neighbors, an uproarious adventure of his last
leave, when a man, tall and spare, with hollowed
cheeks, sunburned skin, eyes deep and shining,
modestly dressed,—a mechanic’s blue trousers,
badly fitting and muddy boots, regulation trooper’s
jacket, with no mark to show his rank,—came
out of the sort of tunnel in which the La Vache<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
trench ended, and stopped as if undecided, in
front of our dugouts.</p>

<p>There was a mounted scout there who was occupying
himself in cutting out a ring, and he asked
him,</p>

<p>“The post of the major of the ... first
battalion?”</p>

<p>Without stopping his work, the man indicated
our group with his hand. He advanced shyly.</p>

<p>“The ... first battalion?”</p>

<p>“This is it,” said the adjutant-major, drawing
his wet head from the canvas bucket in which he
was plunging.</p>

<p>“I am Major C....”</p>

<p>“Oh, Major, I beg your pardon. I didn’t
know....” mopping his face rapidly, and putting
on his tunic which his orderly handed to him.</p>

<p>Without a word, the unperturbed figure,
Major C ..., looked off into the distance, beyond
material things, waited for him to finish
his toilet, and then entered into the P. C. to take
possession of his new post.</p>

<p class="tb">None of us who lived constantly in his immediate
neighborhood ever knew any other expression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
on his firm, cold, almost mystical face. His
hair was poorly cut, his beard was thin and long,
and his voice was gentle, very gentle, so gentle
that one might call it a sad sing-song. All in all
he had none of the outward appearance of the
conventional commander.</p>

<p>Nevertheless he was one of the best.</p>

<p class="tb">Good reputations, they say, take longest to
establish. Only legends come to life spontaneously.
His kindliness and honesty must have belonged
to the legends, because in less than a week
there was not a single man in the battalion who
did not speak of him with respect and admiration.</p>

<p>“He’s a chic type,” they said.</p>

<p>“He’s a man.”</p>

<p>And the men, who love to see their commander
among them, living their life, sharing their labors
and fatigue, experiencing the same trials, knew at
once that he did not belong to that distant and
unknown hierarchy which transmits its orders
from an ivory throne.</p>

<p>From the day he took over his command, he
wanted to see everything for himself and all the
positions in the sector.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>With his knotty baton in his hand, he went
through all the communication trenches, the first-line
trenches, into the saps, verified the riflemen’s
posts, and, it was said, spent nights in the picket
posts.</p>

<p class="tb">When the battalion relieved the 38th at Méharicourt,
the commandant’s post which was assigned
to the major was in an immense house in
the middle of a park which was not much
destroyed.</p>

<p>Since the day before, however, the artillery had
established an observation tower in a poplar and
had foreseen that it would hardly be prudent to
occupy the house. It would be shelled if the battery
were spotted.</p>

<p>The commander learned this, and without saying
a word established his things all the same
in the salon which he used for an office and
bedroom.</p>

<p>The first night and the next morning passed
without incident—not a single shot from the
Boche lines. Aeroplanes flew over at daybreak.</p>

<p>He had invited to lunch, as was his custom,
when we were in cantonment, the doctor, his captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
adjutant-major, and the engineer officer in
charge of the sector.</p>

<p>My relations with him dated back before the
war, so I was with him often, and he frequently
kept me at the table with his guests. I was there
that day.</p>

<p>We had scarcely sat down when they began to
talk of Portugal’s entrance into the war. The engineer
was the manager of a political paper and
his remarks were so keen that we were all interested,
and even the servants stopped to listen.</p>

<p>Just then a shell, the first in two days, burst
somewhere in the neighborhood. The glasses
rattled on the table; we could hear things falling,
and people running by in the street.</p>

<p>The conversation stopped.</p>

<p>The major, who had been as silent as usual
during the meal, spoke up in his quiet voice:</p>

<p>“They say that their artillery is excellent ...
it comes from Creusit”—and he engaged the
journalist in a historical discussion about the armament
and strength of Portugal, which showed a
deep knowledge of the country, in spite of its unexpected
and recent entrance into the ranks of the
Allies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>The journalist seemed to take a lively interest
in this conversation which he had started, but he
instinctively turned his eyes to the windows every
time a shell burst, for now explosions far and
near, the screeching of shells and the falling of
walls indicated clearly that we were the center
of a bombardment.</p>

<p>At each explosion the doctor looked at the
adjutant-major, who kept on eating quietly, as if
to say, “Are you going to stay here much
longer?”</p>

<p>The explosions came nearer and all around us.
We could see plainly the bits of steel which
whistled by the windows, grazing the walls which
they destroyed. We could hear the plaster falling
down the staircase.</p>

<p>As the servant brought the desserts—a Camembert,
crackers, fruit, and white wine—a violent
explosion of a new arrival nearby tore the
window, stuffed with paper, from its hinges and
the draught of air half overturned the orderly
who let the platter fall on the table, to the great
damage of the tablecloth where the white wine
ran out....</p>

<p>“<i>Bigre!</i>” said the major.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>“I think it’s time to get into the cellar.”</p>

<p>The engineer was only waiting for this invitation
to stop the conversation and was half out of
his chair when the major took his arm and sat
him down again.</p>

<p>“In short, Portugal owed its title of Historical
Conquistador to its navy.”</p>

<p>And he began to relate the records of that
valorous nation on the sea from the time these
people on the Tagus served in the Carthaginian
triremes to Vasco da Gama, Magellan, Cabral,
Bartholomew Diaz. Never was conversation
more polished, imaginative, and undisturbed.</p>

<p>A terrific explosion shook the house; part of the
roof rolled down the staircase; the cook and the
waiter jumped into the hall.</p>

<p>“Well, what is it?”</p>

<p>“Major, it fell in the garden, ten feet from the
kitchen.”</p>

<p>“The gentlemen are waiting for their coffee.
Bring it.”</p>

<p>The doctor could stand no more, alleged that
perhaps there were wounded waiting for him at
the dressing station, and asked permission to
withdraw.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>The servants brought in the boiling coffee in a
hurry, and he got up to go, as the commander
said:</p>

<p>“We’ll go along with you. We’ll see whether
the shells have done much damage in the cantonment.”</p>

<p>“But, Commander, do you think it’s prudent
to venture out in the streets just now?”</p>

<p>“It’s my opinion, gentlemen, that the Germans,
who obviously wanted to furnish the music
for our meal, should know that we’ve finished”—and
he lighted his cigar and went out on the
steps.</p>

<p>The neighborhood was badly shattered indeed.
Large holes blocked the street; the artillery observatory
had been hit by a well-aimed shell, had
fallen on a shed and crushed it. Immense craters
had appeared here and there in the garden and
the whole front of the house was splashed with
steel.</p>

<p>The enemy’s fire was letting up; it had almost
ceased.</p>

<p>Heads now appeared at the air-holes of the
cellars trying to see what had happened.</p>

<p>We followed the commander along the main<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
street which led to the dressing post. An aeroplane
in the azure sky, a small silver bird shining
in the sun, went on its giddy way.</p>

<p>With our noses in the air, we watched it pass.
The whistle of a shell approached with a noise
like a panting locomotive.</p>

<p>“There’s the last.”</p>

<p>A frightful crash, a cloud of greenish smoke,
bricks and timbers fall ... cries....</p>

<p>The villa we had just left re-appeared with a
large yawning hole, its walls burning and fallen
apart. The last shell had fallen into the dining
room!</p>

<p>His courage and coolness were not calculated
or put on; they were not an effort of the will.
They were natural.</p>

<p>He was a fatalist like all who have lived long
in Eastern countries. What he had above all was
a powerful control of himself and a sovereign
contempt for danger.</p>

<p>He had an absolutely definite conviction that
he would be killed in the next attack. He had
so thoroughly accustomed himself to the idea
that as a result he had made all arrangements
and now awaited the hour, in the meanwhile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
doing his duty as a commander honorably and
simply.</p>

<p>One evening I went to greet him at his cantonment
at Froissy—he was going on leave the next
day—I asked him, among other things, if it
would be agreeable to him, if I used his horses
while he was gone.</p>

<p>“My horses? I have no further use for them.
They can’t follow me through the trenches and
barbed wire—to the front; coming back ...
they’ll bring me in a canvas. They’ll serve my
successor.”</p>

<p>It would have been perfectly useless to protest.</p>

<p>After a moment of silence when he seemed to
be keenly interested in the ripples of the water in
the canal, he went on:</p>

<p>“I’m going on leave to-morrow, to bid good-by
to mine. That will be the last. What are you
doing this evening?”</p>

<p>“Nothing, Commander.”</p>

<p>“Do you want to make a tour of the sector
with me?”</p>

<p>“At your orders, Commander.”</p>

<p>By the last red rays of the sun setting on the
heights to the north of the Somme, we reached the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
lines through the open path which passed by the
camp kitchens and reached the hill of the Château
de Cappy.</p>

<p>Twilight passed, followed by the most varied
colors.</p>

<p>The red sun as it plunged behind the black
poplars on the wide horizon flooded the sky with
a great yellow light, fiery, burning yellow, like
the gold of flames which gradually grew thin and
pale, and became light like an immense head of
hair.</p>

<p>A little later mauve and violet precursors of
approaching clouds passed slowly from pale to
dark to end in night.</p>

<p>The clear moon came up above the plateau of
the road from Amiens. We walked on, one behind
the other, in silence.</p>

<p>He stopped to look at the sky and I heard him
murmur, “How beautiful it is.”</p>

<p>This twilight must have recalled to him the
skies of the Orient.</p>

<p>“Yes, the sunsets on the sea, in the Indies, in
the Red Sea. I am homesick for the light and the
sea. The light, the sea, the woman; the greatest
joys, the greatest sorrows!!!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>He fell into his revery again.</p>

<p>We reached the orchard above the great
quarry, and an outlying picket warned us that
the path was dangerous.</p>

<p>The commander did not even hear him and
continued to walk on the road from Herbècourt,
bordered by apple trees in blossom.</p>

<p>“Ta-co!”</p>

<p>A German bullet tore through the night, and a
broken branch with its white petals fell at our
feet.</p>

<p>He picked it up and looked at it a long time;
plucked a blossom and put it in his pocket,</p>

<p>“Even the flowers!”</p>

<p>He said nothing more that evening. We went
through the front lines of the sector until late at
night, stopping at the loopholes to observe the
enemy’s position and questioning the sentries.</p>

<p>We got back to Froissy at three o’clock in the
morning, and at six he went to the station at
Guillaucourt and left on his leave.</p>

<p class="tb">When he got back, the attack, they said, was
near; they were preparing for it seriously. He
did not give up attending to the slightest details<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
of the battalion. He showed a paternal interest
in his men, knew the men of all ranks by their
names, and stopped those he met and talked to
them familiarly.</p>

<p>The battalion followed the deep path to the
entrance of the “120 long” to get back to its
positions. A wooden bridge had been constructed
here by the artillery to get their guns across. This
was useless now and made the road so narrow that
the column had to dress back and form by twos.
This long manœuvre compelled the men to mark
time in one spot.</p>

<p>There is nothing especially disagreeable about
marking time for we have seen many other stops
for less reasons, but this evening the Boche artillery
had information of the arrival of the attacking
regiment in the lines and was shelling heavily all
possible ways of access.</p>

<p>A single “77” falling into this crowd of men
would make a hecatomb.</p>

<p>The commander was marching at the head of
the column followed by the intelligence officers of
the companies.</p>

<p>He stopped a moment in front of the bridge
encircled by the explosions of the shells.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>“If a shell would only destroy it!”</p>

<p>But as if for spite, they fell all around and
missed it.</p>

<p>“It must be destroyed.”</p>

<p>There was nothing formal about this order,
and the task wasn’t easy.</p>

<p>He took off his belts, gave his jacket to a man,
and with his chest bare the commander stood up
on the bridge, propped himself on the timbers of
the floor, and began to tear them up.</p>

<p>Ten men imitated him of their own accord.
They finished tearing it down amidst a storm of
shells which raged about, and in the black smoke
of the explosions in which they disappeared for
minutes at a time.</p>

<p>In a quarter of an hour the way was clear; all
that was left was the two laterals which were
planted in the walls of the covered path.</p>

<p>The battalion was engulfed in the whirlpool
and passed without loss.</p>

<p>The commander stood on the pile of materials
and watched the men file past. He was the last
one over.</p>

<p>When we reached the line, he began to walk up
and down incessantly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>The fire of our batteries had been uninterrupted
for three days; and this with the constant whizzing
of shells as they passed over our heads put our
nerves almost as much on edge as the strain of the
approaching attack.</p>

<p>Towards eleven o’clock one night there was an
intense calm all of a sudden.</p>

<p>The firing ceased along the whole line—on
both sides. All was silence, but it was the silence
which precedes the storm, the stupor of nature
after the flash and before the thunder.</p>

<p>The men burrowed in the saps and fell asleep.
The sentries who had not closed an eye for forty-eight
hours continued to fight against sleep.</p>

<p>It was almost impossible to recognize the commander
in his bizarre garb, wrapped in a canvas
instead of a waterproof, his steel helmet covered
with mud, as he wandered up and down the
trenches, with a kind word of encouragement for
each one.</p>

<p>In the “Servian” trench there was an exposed
passage to the German lines. They had blocked
this up by piles of sandbags, chevaux de frise, and
rolls of barbed wire.</p>

<p>As a greater precaution, a sentry was stationed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
there night and day. He was sleeping deeply
when the commander came by. He had to shake
him vigorously to wake him up.</p>

<p>“Say, do you sleep like that when you’re
sentry?”</p>

<p>“I ... it’s true ... I was asleep.”</p>

<p>“That’s not serious. Try hard, if an officer
should come along, you’d not get off with advice.”</p>

<p>“They won’t come along; they’re all snoozing
in their dugouts.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you never know.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m going mad sooner or later. I
haven’t slept a wink for three nights. If the
Boches are as tired as I am they won’t come to
wake us up.”</p>

<p>As he talked, his voice was drawn out more and
more and his head nodded. He was dead with
sleep....</p>

<p>The commander took his rifle from his hands
and said:</p>

<p>“I’m not sleepy, and, besides, I shall sleep
very well to-morrow. I’ll mount guard to-morrow.
Sleep, little one, sleep. We, the old,
have lost our habit of sleep.”</p>

<p>The sentry did not even acquiesce in this invitation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
He had accepted it in advance, for he was
asleep already.</p>

<p>At daybreak when the relief came, the sergeant
who accompanied the new sentry was thunderstruck
when he recognized the commander mounting
guard at the loophole.</p>

<p>“Here’s his rifle. Wake him up when I have
gone. Say nothing about it, for he was very
sleepy.”</p>

<p class="tb">When the signal for the assault was given the
next day, after our first two waves had gained the
enemy trenches without firing a shot, the commander,
who was to go with the third, had scarcely
advanced on the field when the whistle of a single
shell shattered the air.</p>

<p>A “77” burst and a cloud of smoke went up.
His thigh was torn off and we saw him fall in a
pool of blood.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Delpos was getting ready to dash
across with the second section of the company and
he jumped towards him.</p>

<p>“Go on, my friend, the end has come. I am
waiting for it. Tell Captain C ... to take command
of the battalion.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>And during the slow agony which lasted a half
hour he did not stop following attentively the
progress of his men on the conquered positions.</p>

<p>Stretcher-bearers carried his body to the church
in Éclusier.</p>

<p>We buried him simply on the hill at the east of
Cappy in a military cemetery near the canal.</p>

<p>When the news of his death was known in the
battalion, I know more than a hundred who had
seen their best comrades fall beside them, who
wept as though they had lost their fathers....</p>

<p>He was with us only a month.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII<br />
<span class="smaller">THE ATTACK</span></h2>

<p>We had been talking about it for months.
The hour of the great attack has finally
come.</p>

<p>They have been preparing for it ever since we
were transformed into diggers and sappers who
dug trenches, parallels, communication trenches,
and saps, day and night.</p>

<p>It’s going to succeed at last.</p>

<p>This time the artillery preparation won’t be
insufficient.</p>

<p>We have guns, little and big, of every kind, of
every caliber, from the little howitzers set low on
their plates with their large muzzles like those
we used to see on the terrace of the Invalides up
to the great naval guns, long, lean and sharp, like
a cigar, monumental guns of unheard-of size
mounted on gigantic platforms, with covered turrets,
new and odd foreign cannon, long as a train
and mounted on rails.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>And there are projectiles such as the wildest
imagination could not dream of. Whole fields
of shells of every caliber from the small “75”
which now seem like playthings to the enormous
“400’s” which can be moved only by gigantic
jacks.</p>

<p>And over this immense sea of shells they have
stretched a green colored tarpaulin, dotted with
great yellow spots, with great chalky streaks which
in the distance give them the appearance of a field
furrowed by tracks.</p>

<p>We have been encamped in a wood for three
days under tents beside batteries of heavy artillery
waiting for the order to take up our positions for
the attack.</p>

<p>And for these three days our constant occupation
has been to strengthen and set up our huts
again, for every shot from the great neighboring
gun drags them from the ground by the tremendous
displacement of air.</p>

<p>That is all right in the daytime. This Penelope-like
work relieves the monotony and serves
as a counter irritant to nervousness. But the occupation
is less interesting at night.</p>

<p>Finally, about nine o’clock one evening, a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
uproar arose in the companies on the other side
from us and by degrees, like a rising sea, reached
us—we are in our usual place at the extreme wing
of the battalion.</p>

<p>The adjutant had advanced to meet the news
and he came back on the run.</p>

<p>“It’s come this time. They are distributing the
playthings to clear the trenches and they’re going
to give out an additional cup of brandy.”</p>

<p>“Do you believe it will be before to-morrow
morning?”</p>

<p>“Do I believe it. It’s sure, by God! Perhaps
you want them to wait until next winter!”</p>

<p>“No, but you know. There have been so many
orders and counter-orders that one can never be
sure. It ought to rain.”</p>

<p>“Do you think it will rain?”</p>

<p>“Good God! I wish it would. The sooner
we finish the performance, the sooner we’ll get
to bed.”</p>

<p>The colonel’s orderly arrives with the orders:</p>

<p>“The Casanova company of machine guns will
support the second battalion and will take the
designated objective (Hill 707) directly after the
third wave.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>“The third wave! Hum! That’s not good.
The first wave is a promenade, nothing in front.
The second goes over then, but the third has all
the shells, for it’s right in the barrage.”</p>

<p>“And after?”</p>

<p>“After?”</p>

<p>“Say, you must think you’re in a café at La
Cannebière. Perhaps you’d like to order an ice.
This is war, you know.”</p>

<p>“I see it now.”</p>

<p>The distributions are finished at ten o’clock and
we move towards our positions behind the second
battalion.</p>

<p>The men have taken off their belts and all their
useless equipment and are in jackets with their tent
canvas crosswise.</p>

<p>The diluvial rain which has been falling for
some days has stopped this evening. The sky is
as black as ink and we can’t see a yard in front
of us.</p>

<p>The paths were already muddy, but now they
have disappeared after whole regiments have gone
towards the lines without interruption for some
hours. When we reach the communication trench
it is no longer a trench at all, but a stream of fluid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
mud, where we sink over our leggings. We have
to use our hands to pull out our legs when they
get stuck.</p>

<p>“Well, <i>mon vieux</i>, if we have to go clear to
Berlin at this pace, we won’t get there before to-morrow
morning!...”</p>

<p>It is so dark that we can scarcely see the back
of the comrade in front of us. We march in
silence, with our hands on the sheaths of the
bayonet and our mask case to prevent the metal
striking against the sides of the trench.</p>

<p>It is after two o’clock when we reach the lines.
We take our places as best we can, where we can,
and with what we can find.</p>

<p>The saps are filled with companies in reserve
who will guard the trench while we fight.</p>

<p>We find places against the sides of the trench,
in chance dugouts gashed in the parapet. We
have to be careful to keep our feet underneath
us to avoid having our toes crushed in the incessant
coming and going to and fro.</p>

<p>Rifts in the clouds show us that the sky is clearing.
It will be fine.</p>

<p>We talk. We weigh optimistically our chances
of success. But we have to shout into each other’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
ears or we couldn’t hear anything. Above us is
the infernal roar of an incessant bombardment.</p>

<p>Our guns have fired some days without interruption.
And the men never cease praising the
heavy artillery. We have never been supported
in this way. How far we are from the days in
Champagne! We have confidence, absolute
confidence.</p>

<p>Day comes. The sun rises, the bright clear sun,
which will be warm soon, rises over the ridge behind
us. On the broad, many-colored screen of
the sky with its rays of dawning day, the chimney
of the distillery at Frameville, still intact and
standing as though hurling defiance at the Germans,
stands out monumental and black like a
gigantic obelisk.</p>

<p>The countryside never stood out so clearly. I
note the slightest details with a feeling which can
never be effaced. I continue to look persistently
to overcome my nervousness and to have something
else to think about.</p>

<p>I look....</p>

<p>Below, in advance, are light lines of freshly
turned earth. They are the German trenches, and
I think I can see among the apparent ruins the invisible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
loopholes ready to belch forth death. A
little further to the left, a few yards from the
sides of the cliff is a small clump of woods which
seems quiet and deserted. Our shells have started
fires, but the fortified positions which conceal the
machine guns are still there.</p>

<p>I look....</p>

<p>The ground and slope in front of me, close
to the parapet, is empty, bare, torn full of shell
holes. Young trees have been cut down, and the
fallen trees are rotting in the earth under the
growing moss. But daisies, buttercups, wild poppies,
and cornflowers have sprung up and blossomed,
opening out to nature, the sun, and life.</p>

<p>All the fires will shortly rage on these flowers.
The blood of men will flow on them, and to-morrow
their sweetness will be mingled with the
charnel-house of corpses ... our corpses.</p>

<p>Nature has never seemed to me so moving.
Tears come to my eyes. It is not fear. No, it is
not that. There are times when one may be
afraid. Here we realize that fear is a reflex impression,
ridiculous, and above all useless; that
the minutes which are left are perhaps too numbered
to waste in vain sentiments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>But while I look through the mirage of nature,
I have seen a small shriveled figure with trembling
lips, and eyes hollowed with pain and fright; I
have seen small hands—long, pale, emaciated
hands—clasped before a photograph; I have
heard the expression so many times, read it so
many times in the letters on my breast, on my
heart: “Tell me that you will come back. You
are my all, father, mother, brother, child, husband;
tell me that you will be careful, that you
will come back to me,” and a slight uncontrollable,
nervous trembling takes hold of me; but no one
can see it.</p>

<p>The blast of the whistle—the final order—rings
out. I find myself on the slope without
knowing how I came there, in the midst of the
others, beside the lieutenant, at my post.</p>

<p>Under a protecting storm of our “75’s” we
advance towards our objective. The battalion has
already crossed the first line of the Boche trenches
without resistance.</p>

<p>All nervousness is gone now. I am very cool.
The third wave advances in front of us in good
order, in step, without heavy losses. We march
in their wake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>There, thirty yards away, on the right is a
knoll. That is our objective which we must occupy
to prevent the enemy’s reserves coming up.</p>

<p>We draw nearer; my heart begins to beat violently.
It is nervousness. It is the beginning of
the end.</p>

<p>Suddenly a sharp noise stops me; then another
beside my ear. Instinctively I throw myself on
the hill. A sergeant falls near me without a word.
He is dead, a bullet in the middle of his forehead.</p>

<p>We are under the fire of a machine gun which
defends the approach to our objective.</p>

<p>The bullets whistle in a continuous buzz around
us. A sharp burning pain, like a sting; a cry stops
in my throat, on my very lips. I fall.</p>

<p>The fusillade rages. To the right, to the left,
around me everywhere, bullets bury themselves
in the ground. I am wounded, but where? All
my limbs are numb.</p>

<p>I feel a hand take mine and grasp it. It is the
lieutenant, who has already come running to me.</p>

<p>“Good-by for the present.”</p>

<p>“For the present.”</p>

<p>It is nothing. A stone hurled violently by the
bursting of a shell has hit me in the back. It has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
just missed killing me. I remain there a moment
without being able to get my breath back or to
get up.</p>

<p>All around there is an incessant rain of bullets
and shrapnel.</p>

<p>However, I can’t remain there right in the barrage.
I make an effort to catch up with the company.
My fall which took only a few seconds has
put considerable distance between the wave and
me. More than three hundred yards separate us.</p>

<p>I want to run after it, but I can’t.</p>

<p>A greenish cloud rolls like a flood over the plain.
The enemy is launching gas.</p>

<p>Some one out of breath joins me. It is Morin
who took a message to the major. He is now
carrying an order to the lieutenant.</p>

<p>“This is dangerous.”</p>

<p>“One might think so.”</p>

<p>“Commandant Courier was just killed getting
out of the parallel.”</p>

<p>“No?”</p>

<p>“A ‘155’ square in the chest. It killed two
officers and five men. I’ve a splinter in my thigh
and one in my shoulder.”</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">The Attack</span> <a href="#Page_225"><i>See page 225</i></a></p>
</div>

<p>We walk along side by side as fast as we can,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
but slowly nevertheless. We can’t do anything
else. We get tangled in the barbed wire; we
stumble over corpses; we fall headlong into shell
holes. The mud covers the mica in my mask.</p>

<p>A hundred yards in front of us the company
reaches its objective, the hill and the Boche blockhouse.</p>

<p>Two sections have rushed in and are already in
action.</p>

<p>Two more sections throw themselves into a
crater more to the left opposite a clump of trees
which is still held by the enemy.</p>

<p>Suddenly there is a terrific explosion, and the
most violent clap of thunder that can be imagined
sends us head over heels.</p>

<p>The ground trembles, the earth cracks, and
through the crevices oozes a black smoke
which envelops us. Everything is black. Are
we entombed?</p>

<p>A mine has been exploded near us in the entrance.
They shout; they cry. Belts of cartridges
burst in the furnace. A swarm of bees seems to
fly over our heads. The blockhouse has just blown
up with our two sections. It was mined.</p>

<p>When the smoke lifts from the overturned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
ground, all we can see are corpses scattered about.
Our comrades ... our dead!</p>

<p>The enemy wanted to prevent our companies
capturing and organizing it.</p>

<p>We try to see something from the shell hole
where we remain. It is certain death even to try
to raise the head. The bullets glance off the
ground.</p>

<p>Morin wants to join the lieutenant and finish
his errand in spite of everything, but where is he?
Was he in the blockhouse? We can’t see anyone
in front of us.</p>

<p>Our waves of infantry have turned to the right,
invested Herbècourt, and taken it. They are now
fighting in the village. We judge from the columns
of smoke that there are fires. The noise of
the explosion of grenades reaches us.</p>

<p>But in front of us there is no one. It is a breach.
The breach our company ought to have held
firmly closed with its machine guns during the
attack on the village.</p>

<p>The enemy knows this without a doubt. He
has calculated his blow well. He has succeeded.
He is going to launch out from the clump of trees
and take our companies in the rear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>Indeed that is the case. Groups of gray worms
crawl out of the thicket. They reach the ridge.
They are a hundred yards from us. There is no
one to stop them. But where are our two sections?
Are they wiped out too?</p>

<p>“My old Morin, we’re done for.”</p>

<p>Our hands clasp in a fraternal farewell. In
three minutes the Boches will be on us. They will
kill us pitilessly. We hold our revolvers ready,
fingers on the trigger. At least we won’t go alone.</p>

<p>They stand up now and shout. They are going
to make a dash.</p>

<p>“<i>Vorwaerts! Gottfordam isch!</i>”</p>

<p>The harsh sound of the command and the oath
comes to us clearly.</p>

<p>They dash forward to take the crater.</p>

<p>But almost at the end, at scarcely fifty yards,
the four guns of our two sections, hidden in the
shell holes, receive them with a withering fire.</p>

<p>The Boche line cracks, breaks; groups of men
fall in heaps, like puppets.</p>

<p>Our guns fire constantly.</p>

<p>The Boche line wavers, hesitates, the ranks
thin out. We can hear the dead sound of the
falling bodies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>We laugh and laugh; we applaud, crying like
fools:</p>

<p>“There are our two sections. Bravo!”</p>

<p>But behind the files that fall are others in
greater numbers which advance in close ranks,
one after another.</p>

<p>Our fire is slower. Our munitions are exhausted—the
gun crew is firing all the cartridges
of their carbines.</p>

<p>The assailants realize this. Some of the groups
have already reached our emplacements. An incredibly
tall and strong officer hurls himself on a
gun. It is Marseille’s gun. It has been silent
just a moment, but it hasn’t finished its task for
all that.</p>

<p>Marseille tears the barrel from the tripod, and
using it as a gigantic mace beats the officer to
death.</p>

<p>A terrible hand to hand fight follows. The
lieutenant, wounded, dripping with blood, on his
knees on the parapet, stops the demoralized
enemy with shots from his revolver.</p>

<p>But this heroic defense of the breach can’t last
long. Most of our men have fallen and most of
the rest are wounded. The enemy is still advancing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
in close ranks now. He is going to
get by....</p>

<p>Then, from the support trench, which the ...
first Territorials hold, a company dashes out like
a whirlwind, with an irresistible dash. It throws
the mass of the enemy into disorder, and it is
soon just a mob, which turns its back and flees
frantically, as fast as it can go, falling under our
rifle fire, and strewing the ground with corpses
and innumerable wounded who drag themselves
along on the ground begging for mercy.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII<br />
<span class="smaller">WITH ORDERS</span></h2>

<p>“There he is, Captain,” shouted a non-commissioned
intelligence officer.</p>

<p>“It is necessary,” said the captain, “to take
this order to the lieutenant commanding your
company at once. You’ll find that it’s only a
promenade. Go ahead.”</p>

<p>A promenade!</p>

<p>From the Château de Cappy where the headquarters
of our brigade were all one could see
that morning on the horizon was smoke and
flame.</p>

<p>The earth trembles as though there were some
sort of a fanciful, continuous earthquake.</p>

<p>Since the attack began and our waves crossed
the first Boche lines, the enemy’s artillery planted
on the heights of Cléry, Mont St. Quentin,
Barleux has sent over a formidable barrage to
prevent all possibility of the arrival of reinforcements.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>It hopes to cut off in the rear the forces engaged
in the attack, to encircle them, to exterminate
or capture them. A wall of shell and fire
separates them from us. Three hundred yards
in front of the heights of the La Vache woods
from La Vierge clear to Dompierre and Fontaine-les-Cappy,
it is one uninterrupted explosion of
great shells which throw to great heights enormous
masses of earth and stones almost as
though they were gushing from the bowels of
the earth.</p>

<p>This waste of shells is further beautified with
“tear” shells and asphyxiating shells and is designed
to stop all attempts at passing the barrage.</p>

<p>This is the delightful place in which I have to
take a “promenade.”</p>

<p>I adjust my mask, make sure that the straps
are on, and secure my steel helmet by the chin
strap.</p>

<p>With the order in the pocket of my revolver
case, a solid boxwood baton in my hand, I start
towards the fiery furnace.</p>

<p>The communication trench which I try to follow
is impracticable. It is partly blown in and
such dugouts as are still tenable are full of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
wounded fleeing from the zone of combat. They
crowd in pell-mell in their efforts to find a breathing
place.</p>

<p>Then, sooner or later, after the La Vache
woods are passed, one has to walk absolutely
unprotected so one might as well go at once.</p>

<p>Few projectiles are falling here on the great
quarry as yet, but only a few shots too long or
too short from the great guns aimed at the ammunition
depot at Froissy.</p>

<p>The barrage is further on....</p>

<p>As one approaches it, the earth and air seem
to tremble even more....</p>

<p>One walks on a moving wave, as if tossed about
on the bridge of a ship. A displacement of air
throws one to the right, the next one to the left.
They march swaying like drunken men.</p>

<p>I approach....</p>

<p>Some steps in front of what was the “Servian”
trench is the beginning of Hell.</p>

<p>Men, officers, and stretcher-bearers are crouching
in holes in half-blown-in saps, waiting for a
lull which for several hours has not come.</p>

<p>The sick and wounded, haggard and frightened,
do not dare to make a move outside the precarious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
shelters which even the smallest shell would destroy
and bury them alive.</p>

<p>A Zouave, with a swarthy face and a profile
like a medallion, gesticulates and shouts. A long
gash cuts his forehead from the arch of his eyebrows
to the ear; the blood flows thick and black
on his cheek and runs into his beard. He waves
a rag on the end of a stick.</p>

<p>“The noubah! the noubah! It is the noubah!
They are going to dance. You’ll dance with me,
won’t you?”</p>

<p>And he runs towards the bombs, laughing a
frightful laugh which makes me shudder. Poor
fool! A hole opens under his feet. He falls.
Perhaps the fall will save him from a mortal
wound.</p>

<p>Some Colonials, fatalists, accustomed to so
many other storms—for two years they have
been in the hottest part of all the engagements—talk
coolly under a dugout which is still intact.
They squat on their crossed legs and smoke peacefully.
The smoke from their pipes, rising in slow
easy curves, seems to set at defiance the frightful
cataclysm which rages around us.</p>

<p>A stretcher-bearer, a priest, whom I think I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
recognize, is dressing a wounded man who has
escaped in some way from the furnace and who
faints in his arms. Intent on his bandaging he
seems to have no idea of the Hell two steps away.
He gives him the same care with the same imperturbable
calm that he would in the absolute
security of some faraway ambulance.</p>

<p>A staff-officer, a captain, is observing the ground
through a glass. As is my case, he is carrying an
urgent order which cannot wait.</p>

<p>He looks at me and understands from my
attitude that I, too, must go on.</p>

<p>“Shall we try it?”</p>

<p>“If you wish, Captain.”</p>

<p>“In case of accident, my pocketbook is in the
pocket of my jacket, here ... you will take it
to the officer of details of the ... first Zouaves.”</p>

<p>“Mine is here, Captain.”</p>

<p>I indicate the left pocket of my tunic.</p>

<p>“All right.”</p>

<p>“Let’s go.”</p>

<p class="tb">He grasps my hand and we advance flat on the
ground, bounding from one shell hole to another
farther ahead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>We compel our bodies to take the shape of the
excavation in which we burrow.</p>

<p>Above our heads is a continuous whistling of
shells, cutting like a sword, and the constant djji-djji
of the projectiles which tear up the ground.</p>

<p>The explosions are so frequent that we perceive
only one infernal noise under a rain of fire.</p>

<p>We crawl through an indescribable chaos, in a
field of terror, in the midst of a pungent, fetid
smoke. We reach the first German trench which
we conquered yesterday morning. We jump into
it; we are dripping with perspiration; our clothes
are in rags. Our first act is to raise our masks
for we are stifling under them.</p>

<p>The asphyxiating shells now fall behind us,
and their noxious gas blows in another direction
away from us. We stop for some seconds to
regain our breaths. We must go on.</p>

<p>As we are about to climb out on the field again,
I see one of our couriers coming at full speed.
I must wait for him and learn where my company
is.</p>

<p>But he stops, leans backwards, and his hands
contract and seem to try to pull something from
his breast. He falls inert.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>I crawl towards him. A spasm still shakes
him. He looks at me.</p>

<p>“The company! Where is the company?”</p>

<p>“——Maisonnette——” he murmurs in a
faraway breath, then, with an effort, his shaking
hand reaches towards his jacket, but without
success.</p>

<p>“Sergeant-Major ... there ... there ...
to my mother ... in La Ciotat....”</p>

<p>“Yes, <i>mon vieux</i>, yes.”</p>

<p>He is dead. I am trembling but I search for
his pocketbook. It is sewed in a handkerchief
and in drawing it out it is spotted with blood—his
blood. I shall send it to his mother just that
way. It is forbidden, but what difference does
that make? I have promised.</p>

<p>La Maisonnette! It is still three miles, perhaps
more. I’ll never get there! The staff-officer
leaves me; he is going to the La Chapitre woods
to the left.</p>

<p>We grasp hands once more.</p>

<p>“Thanks.”</p>

<p>Yes, thanks! Together we have done a most
difficult thing—we have passed through a
barrage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, I go on across that terrible plateau,
alone.</p>

<p>Alone!</p>

<p>If a splinter of a shell hits me, no one will be
with me during my last moments to listen to my
final wishes. I continue my way under the rain
of shells.</p>

<p>Why I have not already been blown to pieces
or buried I do not know. How little one feels in
the face of this formidable power!</p>

<p>I turn around. On both sides and behind me
there is no one! I am in a desert in which a
hail of fire falls. Will I get there?</p>

<p>At every step I cross, touch, jump over, as I
run against them, formless corpses, cut to pieces,
or doubled into knots.</p>

<p>Perhaps in a moment I shall be like them, disemboweled
and my brains running out, or like
those over there buried under rubbish and dirt.
I can see a foot here, an arm there; they are
entombed forever. I shall be listed among the
missing, and my family and those who love me
will cling to this shred of hope—that the missing
is perhaps not dead.</p>

<p>I go on steadily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>Abruptly, I experience a nervous reaction. I
laugh.... I become a fatalist! And after?...
I shall not be alone. That’s the common
lot of millions of men.</p>

<p>What is going to happen will happen. Forward.</p>

<p>And I crawl on anew, thinking of everything
else—a mass of things a hundred leagues away;
trifles; paltry trifles. I surprise myself by making
plans which I shall realize after the war—when
that is over! And, nevertheless, death hovers
over me constantly, threatening, and I am much
nearer to it than life.</p>

<p>A trench opens before me; it is not badly demolished.
I enter it and find that it is an old
one taken from the enemy this morning. German
words indicate directions. They abandoned all
their belongings. On a plank in a sentry post
is a superb pair of prismatic field glasses. I pick
them up—what use are they to me? I throw
them down at once.</p>

<p>I have enough to look out for close by without
trying to see what’s happening farther away.</p>

<p>“<i>Nach Maisonnette.</i>”</p>

<p>This direction before my eyes fascinates me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>“To Maisonnette.” Well, I’m on the right
track. If the trench continues like this I have
some chance of arriving there: <i>nach Maisonnette</i>.</p>

<p>I mark the directions at each turn of the trench,
at each branch.</p>

<p>A big shell bursts on my left and utterly destroys
the whole of the wall behind me.</p>

<p>I take another course. The devil! Suppose
that should be wrong.</p>

<p>I reach a sort of crater made up of stones and
trunks of trees blown apart and broken, in one
complete tangle.</p>

<p>It would hardly be wise to stay here, for the
crater is hammered full of shell holes.</p>

<p>A voice comes out of the ground between the
stones, at my feet.</p>

<p>“Oh, good morning, Margis. Keep to the
right; the first street to the left is Peronne.”</p>

<p>I recognize the joking voice and constant
laugh of Sub-Lieutenant Delpos.</p>

<p>I have arrived; the company is here!</p>

<p>This hole is Maisonnette!</p>

<p>All right!...</p>

<p>And I jump into the protection of the bottom
of the sap.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>At last!!!</p>

<p>White wine, brandy, fine preserves. Sub-Lieutenant
Delpos never lacks for anything even
in the most tragic hours of his life.</p>

<p>He makes an elegant and comfortable dugout
out of the most filthy hole.</p>

<p>Ten miles from the living world, six feet
under ground, in the midst of the shell fire, ten
feet from the enemy, he offers me, with a laugh,
a meal which is prodigious under the circumstances.</p>

<p>Coharé makes coffee on a burner and he flavors
it with brandy.</p>

<p>We talk of many things, of a thousand things,
all a hundred leagues removed from the war.
We talk about Marseilles.</p>

<p>Sub-Lieutenant Delpos is a lover of its picturesqueness,
of its color, its sun—we are in a
deep sap lighted by a smoky candle—the sun
means something to us, something fairylike and
superhuman. To think that at that hour there
are people living under clear skies, coming and
going and breathing the strong sea breeze, and
drinking in with their eyes that perpetual delight—a
sunset on the rocks of Frioul!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>And the women of Marseilles! They are the
quintessence of France, revivified by the air of
the Mediterranean. Just think, <i>mon cher</i>, of
a villa perched in the pines, facing the sea, in
the valley of L’Oriol, with a brunette that I
know,</p>

<p>...! ...!</p>

<p>“Oh, I forget, I must present you to the other
gentlemen. Come.”</p>

<p>We emerge from the sap and come out in broad
daylight. In a crater organized in the expectation
of a probable counter attack, guarded by the
strongest men of the section, twelve German
prisoners are stretched out in the mud.</p>

<p>Some of them stand up automatically at the
appearance of an officer and assume a rigid
military attitude.</p>

<p>“Look at that rabble with their blessed faces
like professors of natural history or like sacristans
mumbling their prayers. Who would
think to look at them that they are such cynical
brutes?”</p>

<p>“But I forgot. You speak German!...
Try and get something out of them.”</p>

<p>So I ask them where they come from.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>No one replies. Their eyes remain hostile and
timid and full of fear.</p>

<p>They distrust one another; informing is the
common practice in their ranks.</p>

<p>I look at one in particular, and, taking him
by the arm,</p>

<p>“<i>Dü! wohen bist dü dann?</i>”</p>

<p>“<i>Aus München....</i>”</p>

<p>From Munich. Munich! I passed the best
days of my youth there. Its splendid life, the
magic of its lakes, the first iridescent snows of
the Tyrol reflecting in their dark waters, the intoxication
of its music, Munich! the city of my
dreams! The mystic grayish tints of the inns
more smoky even than those of Auerbach but
lighter, the impressive harmony of the statues,
its incomparable museums, the June evenings on
the Isar and the blue sunsets of the Propylées.
Munich! And this man in rags, this tatterdemalion
speaks to me of Munich.</p>

<p>“Well, Margis, are you wandering?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Lieutenant. As a matter of fact I was
woolgathering.”</p>

<p>And I come back to cruel reality.</p>

<p>“Since you must return to the brigade at once,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
you can take this crowd to the provost. I’ll
give you four men. That will be enough.”</p>

<p>“All right, Lieutenant, but I’ll not guarantee
to deliver them whole. It’s a bad neighborhood.
It rains shells.”</p>

<p>He looks at them and they are ready. All they
have to do is to group themselves.</p>

<p>“Go ahead, au revoir,—and a safe return.”</p>

<p>“<i>Nun jetz Vorwaerts!</i>”</p>

<p>We go back along the road I came by this
morning. The artillery fire has let up a little.
As far as the crossing of the roads from Biaches
to Herbècourt, we march along without much
risk, but beyond there we are taken anew by a
crossfire from the batteries of Barleux and Hem,
and by the fire of a cursed machine gun. It
seems to be hidden in the ruins of Flaucourt,
but our artillery has not been able to spot it yet
and silence it.</p>

<p>My twelve prisoners march along ahead
silently with bowed shoulders. They understand
that they must march along peacefully at the same
pace as the four big fellows who form the escort,
and that once out of this zone their lives are
saved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>We reach without incident the old road which
cuts the Le Signal woods, and get back on the
road from Herbècourt to Éclusier. An orchard
here which before the attack was a signal station
has not suffered much. The dugouts are whole
and I stop my troop to look after my leg which
has begun to bleed.</p>

<p>A little while ago, as I was crossing some
barbed wire entanglements, I felt a tear but I
thought it was of no consequence. But now
the blood has soaked through the drawers and
trousers. I tear off a strip from my package of
dressings and put on a bandage which stops the
bleeding until we reach the next dressing station.</p>

<p>I have hardly put my equipment on again than
I hear beyond me in the road an infernal noise of
scrap iron, oaths and cries.</p>

<p>I jump up.</p>

<p>It is our movable kitchen driven by Gondran.
Yesterday, it went ahead to Herbècourt on premature
orders. To-day, it was right in the barrage.
Now that the long expected lull has come,
the lieutenant is sending it back to Froissy.</p>

<p>On the way back Gondran met four wounded
men who were getting to the rear only with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
greatest difficulty, and he took them on his rickety
wagon. This torpedo, with its big sheet-iron
smokestack which is full of holes and twisted,
doesn’t look much like an ambulance. Instead,
one might think it was some archaic engine of war
of the Gauls.</p>

<p>Phoebe and Lidoire, the two lean hacks which
drag it, are marked and cut by the harness and
their legs are bent from pulling this badly
balanced weight.</p>

<p>Suddenly, the bombardment, which seemed to
have ceased, begins again. First two shots, then
repeated more and more rapidly, and only in
our direction. A shower of splinters beats
around us, wounds the two horses and cuts the
reins.</p>

<p>They run away at a mad pace with wild plunges
through the fields. Gondran is wounded in the
hands and is helpless; he clings to the smokestack;
the wounded are tossed about. They shout from
the pain of their re-opened wounds and hang on
as best they can to the handle of the kettle.</p>

<p>The speed of the two horses becomes giddy.
They head for the quarry at a gallop. A hundred
yards more and they will inevitably fall into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
canal, a fall of more than fifty yards. That would
mean their utter destruction.</p>

<p>I have no choice of ways in which to save the
five men.</p>

<p>With six shots from my revolver I kill one
horse and throw the other to the ground. The
kitchen comes to a stop twenty yards from the
cliff.</p>

<p>But danger is not averted by any manner of
means. Shells follow us. From some faraway
place an observer must have taken us for a “75”
getting into position and he tries to destroy us.
We abandon the kitchen which is now almost
completely done for, and as fast as we can, saved
by some miracle from the shells, which double
in intensity, we throw ourselves into the first
trench we find.</p>

<p>I find the Territorials and the provost at the
great quarry and I hand my prisoners over to him.</p>

<p>It is only a step from there to headquarters.
I arrive at six o’clock.</p>

<p>Captain Chatain is outside the door, and I give
him the reply he is waiting for.</p>

<p>He runs it over with a smile of satisfaction.</p>

<p>“Everything went all right, Sergeant-Major?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, Captain.”</p>

<p>“Good. Didn’t I tell you that it would simply
be a promenade ... but I’ll recommend you
for a citation.”</p>

<p>Half an hour later I was snoring soundly in a
dugout.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX<br />
<span class="smaller">A WREATH</span></h2>

<p>We fell back in good order—in as good
order as our wounds and the enemy’s
artillery fire permitted.</p>

<p>There is a roll call of the company, now reduced
in numbers by half, in the ruins of Dompierre, now
cleared out, conquered and organized.</p>

<p>None of the two sections surprised in the explosion
of the mine came back.</p>

<p>There are great gaps in the ranks of the other
two, especially among the non-commissioned officers.
One sergeant out of four and two or three
corporals are seriously wounded.</p>

<p>As names are called and there is no response,
we look around as though to search better. Lips
seem to murmur, “What, he too?” Eyes search
the distance, the turn of the road at the entrance
of the village, as if they still expect to see him
come. But no one comes. They will never come
again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>The lieutenant has to furnish all possible information
about each one missing.</p>

<p>“Did you see him fall? Who was near him?
Was he wounded? Do you think he was killed?
Did he stay there motionless?”</p>

<p>There were as many inexact replies as there
were questions. No one knew exactly or could
know exactly whether the fallen was killed or
wounded; appearances are deceitful. In the uproar
of battle, he who seems dead is not even touched.
Another may have had to stay hidden a long
time to avoid being killed or made a prisoner.</p>

<p>Opposite the name of each absent one the
quartermaster writes:</p>

<p>“Missing the ... presumably killed at....”</p>

<p>After the roll call we separate silently. The
most severely wounded are at the dressing stations,
and several are discharged by the ambulances
from the rear: Sergeant Pierron had four
fingers of his right hand blown off; Sergeant Durosiers
with a shoulder broken by a bit of shell;
Corporal Goutelle shot through the thigh, and
has lost a lot of blood.</p>

<p>We accompany them as far as the ambulances
which take them to the casualty clearing stations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>Adjutant Dotant and Sergeant Lace take the
initiative in buying a wreath and take up a collection
among the men of their sections.</p>

<p>“Lieutenant, if you will allow us, we are going
to buy a wreath at Harbonnières and this evening
two of us will go and place it on our comrades.”</p>

<p>Too moved to answer, the lieutenant acquiesces
with a nod.</p>

<p>Morin and I, the only two who are not wounded,
offer to carry it. Our errand is not without
danger; but we start off at nightfall.</p>

<p>The wreath is light but large, and its width
makes it difficult to get through the narrow
trenches.</p>

<p>We have to hold it at arms’ length in certain
places above our heads on the parapet and slide
it along.</p>

<p>Its ornaments catch in the stones and the twigs.</p>

<p>It runs serious dangers before it reaches its
destination.</p>

<p>At Herbècourt the trench stops some yards in
front of the entrance to the village. It is raining
shells.</p>

<p>The shells rage particularly on the road which
runs through the village, the only one along which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
supplies can go. There is no longer a well-marked
road. The well taken care of highway no longer
exists; it is full of holes and is but one yawning
crevasse more than three hundred yards long.
The wagons and trucks have made a chance path
in the neighboring fields. They wait at the entrance
of the village, some yards from the point
where the barrage persists, for a lull. When it
comes, they rush like a whirlwind with a mad burst
of speed, and it is a miracle that they are not
crushed. All one hears are oaths, cries, blows;
wagons lock together, horses fall and get up at
once; all this in the twinkling of an eye. Thirty
wagons pass between two shells.</p>

<p>We, too, make a dash and reach the other end
without much risk. The danger is greater from
the autos which rush by us like meteors, graze us,
and threaten a hundred times to cut us to pieces
or to catch our clothes and drag us under the
wheels. But the greatest danger is from the tottering
walls, and the waving roofs which the
rolling of the wagons brings falling down.</p>

<p>We reach the cemetery at the beginning of the
country. It is still nearly intact. Graves are
turned up; tombstones are thrown down on their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
sides. Its walls are holed with loopholes, which
served the last defenders of the village. But the
grass is not even tramped down in the corners.</p>

<p>“Can’t we stay here five minutes to get our
breath?”</p>

<p>“If you want to.... We deserve it.”</p>

<p>A battery of “75’s” held the position a few
minutes ago. It has just abandoned it to get
nearer the lines. The place is deserted; it is like
a visit in the country at two steps from the fiery
furnace. We stretch out on a mound of turf between
two tombs.</p>

<p>It is the hour of twilight; the sky is golden; the
sun on the horizon plunges into the marshes of
the Somme. A fresh breeze blows through the
privet hedge.</p>

<p>“A summer evening in the country!”</p>

<p>“Within the country would be more in accord
with the circumstances, I think.”</p>

<p>As if to make my punning more emphatic, four
“77’s” burst at the same time and smash the
cemetery walls to bits.</p>

<p>“<i>Foutre!</i>” This expression, peculiar to Marseilles,
has a significant meaning on Morin’s lips.</p>

<p>“You have said it; the place is no longer safe.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>“The battery changed its position because it
had just been spotted. We are taking its place
and are a target for the Boche artillery.”</p>

<p>We make our way forward as fast as we can.</p>

<p>The bombardment of the abandoned position
behind us continues in volleys of four shells at a
time. The cemetery we just left is nothing but a
ruin, a chaos from which black smoke rises.</p>

<p>We keep on running, each holding an end of
the wreath which impedes us terribly. Although
it is light, it seems heavy.</p>

<p>Night falls and it is very dark. We are able
to advance with more security now. Yawning
craters open at our feet; we risk falls and sprains
at every step.</p>

<p class="tb">It is the dead of night when we reach the place
where our company was decimated.</p>

<p>An immense mass of humanity fills the place
with a tragic tangle of intertwined corpses.
Burned with powder, licked by the flames, torn
and blown to pieces, the bodies cling to the wall
as if they wanted to fly from the deadly fire coming
from the depths of the earth.</p>

<p>Indeed, planted on this host of bodies, his legs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
sinking in up to his knees, the body of Sergeant
Bacque seems to point out the road to deliverance
with a gesture. His hands hold the pickets of a
cheval de frise. A shell decapitated him at the
very moment when he jumped and death fixed him
in this attitude.</p>

<p>Thin smoke still comes from the bottom of this
sinister vat! It is Hell in all its horror. The men
saw death coming and tried to flee, but death was
victor and fixed them to the spot.</p>

<p>The burial of our friends would be a titanic
task for our exhausted strength. We gather into
a single pile the scattered bodies which the explosion
hurled to a distance. With some barbed wire
we hang the company’s wreath on the cheval de
frise which commands the great grave. It faces
the Boches.</p>

<p>To-morrow at sunrise they can see it from their
nearest trench and read on its tricolored ribbon
the inscription, “To our comrades, to our
brothers, from the survivors of the second company
of machine guns.” They will see how we
pay homage to our heroes even under the threat
of their shells.</p>

<p>The drone of a cannon sounds in the English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
sector in the distance. One might think that there
was a tacit truce on our side to let the dead sleep
more peacefully in their last sleep.</p>

<p>We remain there kneeling before the hecatomb.
Our lips search for the prayers of our childhood
to lay our dead at rest, but they have lost the habit
of prayer and our memories fail at the first words.
We wish a prayer which shall give their final
blessing to the bodies stretched out there, but
above all we want a prayer which shall give a
kindly consolation in the approaching hour of
anguish to those who wait—to the mothers,
wives, sweethearts, who do not know, who hope
and live in the dream of their joyous return. And
our scepticism makes us unable to pray.</p>

<p>The darkness of the night is absolute.</p>

<p>The charnel-house of our comrades is only a
dark mass in the shadows. A pungent, pestilential
odor already rises; we sense the sinister rustling
of the rats which slip between the bodies.</p>

<p>Groans rise on all sides in the darkness. Some
shriek horribly in their agony; there are long
wails; plaintive sing-songs call beloved names,
childish words.</p>

<p>Death, with its accomplice, Darkness, gleans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
the last rebellious one who clings desperately
to life.</p>

<p class="tb">Behind us mounts the heavy rolling of the convoys.
It is the hour for the nightly supplies. The
autos dash along on the torn up roads in the endeavor
to accomplish their difficult mission before
the probable barrage fire begins again.</p>

<p>On the top of the ridge where the enemy maintains
his lines for the moment, a searchlight throws
its light on the ground and in the sky, in all directions,
watching for aeroplanes and searching for
the passing of convoys on the road. Its light
passes back and forth over us several times, hitting
us in the face and dazzling us. It passes back
and forth, flooding the plain with its moving brilliant
light. In its light we see moving forms:
stretcher-bearers saving the wounded and plunderers
of the dead.</p>

<p>Suddenly, the whizz of a shell comes our way,
and a light bursts high in the air. Shrapnel launch
their rain of fire and shell on the plain.</p>

<p>“Let’s go....”</p>

<p>We had scarcely time to throw ourselves flat
on the ground when there was a tremendous explosion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
A “380” perhaps bursts on the middle
of the mound of corpses and scatters it. One
would think that maddened by its orgy of murder,
the enemy horde wants to kill our dead anew.
A geyser of blood spouts up and boils from the
mound.</p>

<p>We try to flee but our limbs fail us. An invincible
force rivets us to the spot, as we try to jump
ahead.</p>

<p>Morin utters a hoarse cry, a cry like an animal
that is being slaughtered. A corpse was thrown
up in the air and falls squarely on him and throws
him to the ground. He is underneath, hemmed
in by its shrivelled arms; streams of blood deluge
him.</p>

<p>I try to get him out, but I can’t. My hands
feel around on the mangled body. I feel the shattered
limbs come apart under the clothes. I pull
Morin out from underneath by his arms. He remains
motionless for a moment. He is stupid
from the shock and fright. I shake him. The
arrival of a new engine of death which explodes
beside us brings him back to reality and the imminence
of danger.</p>

<p>This time we run as fast as we can, stumbling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
over the débris, tripping over the dead, rolling
into shell holes, tearing our clothes, hands, and
faces on the barbed wire.</p>

<p>We flee, absolutely breathless, across old
trenches which we see only when their depths yawn
before our steps.</p>

<p>We flee haggard, in a mad delirium, terrified,
pursued by the vision of our dead, of their dim
faces, their torn brows, their glassy eyes, their
twisted mouths, which the shells still mangle
... which the enemy kill again in their sleep of
death.</p>

<p>We flee encircled by the rattle of the fire which
pursues us, and which with us draws near the
road which we wish to reach and it to bar.</p>

<p>A more violent puff, and close by, grazes our
heads.</p>

<p>“Attention!... Stop.... To earth!”</p>

<p>A violent shock, a heavy blow between the
shoulders, a hard vice grips my body and throws
me on the ground.</p>

<p>I fall.</p>

<p>I fall, and then I remember nothing more.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX<br />
<span class="smaller">DISCHARGED</span></h2>

<p>“Come, <i>mon vieux</i>, swallow this; it will set
you up.”</p>

<p>A sergeant of the 88th Territorials is speaking.
I see his white number as he bends over me. I
swallow the contents of the cup at one draught.
Ouf! it’s strong; it burns, but I feel my strength
coming back.</p>

<p>Where am I?</p>

<p>I am behind a bank in a dugout cut in the side
of the trench. How I got there I don’t know.
I have lost all idea of things.</p>

<p>I am anxious about Morin. They don’t know,
but they say that they saw stretcher-bearers pick
him up.</p>

<p>I have received my reckoning, but I shall recover.
I feel my trousers and boots heavy with
a tepid dampness. I feel a shooting pain in the
groin and something like a warm stream flows
drop by drop.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>The stretcher-bearer, Bertrand, an old college
friend, now a Dominican, stops a second beside
me, hurrying on to more pressing cares, to the
more seriously wounded. He speaks kindly simple
words, but what they are I know not. He speaks
of country, the sun, my wife.</p>

<p>My wife, the sun, the country, the return to
life, the walks as of old in the woods, in the hills,
the dreams at twilight, the cherished plans, the
talk of love. Life is beginning again. Yes, we
will begin all that again. And it will be finer
now ... after the test.</p>

<p>A great relaxation comes; tears flow. I hardly
suffer, but I am weak. I want to sleep.</p>

<p>The stretcher-bearers will come presently, as I
know, at nightfall. And through the roof of
boughs I see the sun die away and the stars come
out.</p>

<p>The bombardment rolls in distant thunder; they
say that it is increasing, coming nearer.</p>

<p>Does that mean a counter attack?</p>

<p>The sinister heavy blow of a great Boche shell
shakes the earth of my dugout, and the leaves of
my roof fall in torrents on my covering.</p>

<p>I already feel anxious to get away. I am afraid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
now. I dread the final wound which will tear me,
shatter me, kill me.</p>

<p>It is dark night. Great drops begin to fall. It
is going to rain very hard. The stretcher-bearers
have come. I have to move so that they can place
me on the stretcher. I feel the warm stream gush
out; it is very strong this time.</p>

<p>And I fainted.</p>

<p class="tb">At the casualty clearing station at Villers an
old major with a white beard gives me an injection
of antitetanic serum.</p>

<p>Another examines my gaping wound.</p>

<p>“Iodine dressing, H. O. E.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Discharge to
private life.”</p>

<p>And an automobile takes me speedily to the
station where the sanitary train waits with
steam up.</p>

<p>The sanitary train!... For two days each
roll of the wheels sounds in my head like a great
bell; and the belt which binds me seems tightened
into the most atrocious notch; at each turn of the
wheels, at every movement it seems to me that
the stream will begin to flow again, and that this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
time it will all flow out until it is exhausted ...
with my life.</p>

<p>Then, one evening, the rolling ceased; my
stretcher was unhooked and they gave me something
to drink.... I woke up in the hospital.</p>

<p>A white bed, lights, nurses in white, who speak,
who smile, who glide over the floors without making
a noise.</p>

<p>Can it be true? I no longer hear the noise,
the hammering of cannon, and the infernal rolling
of autos and caissons. It is strange.</p>

<p>“Take No. 7 to the operating room,” says the
head doctor.</p>

<p>I am No. 7.</p>

<p>The operating room.... It is all bright and
white; through haggard eyes I look at the shining
knives, the reflection of the glass, but a sharp
odor seizes me, sickens me, stifles me.</p>

<p>I am stifling.... My breath stops in my chest
and no longer reaches my throat.... I am
stifling.... No, I hear the bells.... I hear
the bells.... How good they sound!</p>

<p class="tb">Is it a dream?</p>

<p>An anxious face, shining eyes, lips trembling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
with a kiss, the beautiful loved hair with its familiar
perfume.</p>

<p>And the gentle caress on my forehead.</p>

<p>Both arms close about it feverishly, as if never
to let it go, on this dear being who brings with
her kiss: love, life, the future.</p>

<p>“Oh! you! you! at last! forever!”</p>

<p>“Yes, Georges, yes, forever. I am here.”</p>

<p>And the nurse standing at the foot of the little
brass bed smiles with tears in her eyes.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
